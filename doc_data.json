&departments print overviewflu, also called influenza, is an infection of the nose, throat and lungs, which are part of the respiratory system. the flu is caused by a virus. influenza is commonly called the flu, but it's different from the stomach \"flu\" viruses that cause diarrhea and vomiting. most people with the flu get better on their own. but sometimes, influenza and its complications can be deadly. some groups of people are at a higher than average risk of having flu complications, including: young children, especially those age 12 months or younger. people who plan to be pregnant, are pregnant or recently gave birth during flu season. adults older than age 65. people who live or work in facilities with many other residents. examples are those in nursing homes and military barracks, as well as people who are in the hospital. and in the united states, some groups have a higher risk of needing treatment in the hospital for flu. those groups include people who are american indian or alaska native, black or latino. other groups at high risk for flu complications include people with: weakened immune systems. a body mass index (bmi) of 40 or higher. nervous system disorders or conditions that change how the brain processes information. and people with certain medical conditions have a higher risk of flu complications, such as: people who have chronic illnesses, such as asthma, heart disease, kidney disease, liver disease and diabetes. people who have had strokes. people who are younger than 20 years of age and receiving long-term aspirin therapy. although the annual influenza vaccine isn't 100% effective, it lowers the chances of having severe complications from the flu. this is especially true for people who are at high risk for flu complications.products & servicesa book: mayo clinic book of home remedies symptomsat first, the flu may seem like a cold with a runny nose, sneezing and sore throat. colds usually start slowly. but

viruses travel through the air in droplets when someone with the infection coughs, sneezes or talks. you can inhale the droplets directly. or you can pick up the germs from touching an object, such as a computer keyboard, and then touching your eyes, nose or mouth. people with the virus are likely contagious from about a day before symptoms appear until about 5 to 7 days after they start. children and people with weakened immune systems may be contagious for a slightly longer time. influenza viruses are constantly changing, with new strains appearing often. if you've had influenza in the past, your body has already made antibodies to fight that specific strain of the virus. if future influenza viruses are like those you've come across before, either by having the disease or by getting vaccinated, those antibodies may prevent infection or lessen its severity. but antibody levels may decline over time. and antibodies against past influenza viruses may not protect you from new influenza strains. new strains can be very different from what you had before. risk factorsfactors that may raise your risk of getting the flu or its complications include: age. seasonal influenza tends to have worse outcomes in young children, especially those age 12 months and younger. adults older than age 65 also tend to have worse outcomes. living or working conditions. people who live or work in facilities with many other residents, such as nursing homes, are more likely to get the flu. people who are staying in the hospital also are at higher risk. weakened immune system. cancer treatments, anti-rejection medicines, long-term use of steroids, organ transplant, blood cancer or hiv/aids can weaken the immune system. this can make it easier to catch the flu virus and may increase the risk of developing complications. chronic illnesses. chronic conditions may increase the risk of influenza complications. examples include asthma and other lung diseases, diabetes, heart disease, nervous system diseases, previous history of stroke, metabolic disorders, problems with the airway, and kidney, liver or blood disease. race or ethnicity. in the united states, people who are american indian or alaska native, black, or latino all may have a higher risk of influenza complications. aspirin use under age 20. people who are younger than 20 years of age and receiving long-term aspirin therapy are at risk of developing reye's syndrome if infected with the influenza virus. pregnancy. pregnant people are more likely to develop influenza complications, particularly in the second and third trimesters. this risk continues up to two weeks after the baby is born. obesity. people with a body mass index (bmi) of 40 or higher have an increased risk of flu complications. complicationsif you're young and healthy, the flu usually isn't serious. although you may feel awful while you have it, the flu usually goes away in a week or two with no lasting effects. but children and adults at high risk may develop complications that may include: pneumonia. bronchitis. asthma flare-ups. heart problems. ear infections. acute respiratory distress syndrome. pneumonia is one of the most serious complications. for older adults and people with chronic illnesses, pneumonia can be deadly. prevention flu vaccines at mayo clinic mayo clinic offers flu shots in arizona, florida and minnesota. learn more about how to get your flu shot at mayo clinic the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) recommends annual flu vaccination for everyone age 6 months or older. the flu vaccine can lower your risk of getting the flu. the flu vaccine lowers your risk of having serious illness from the flu and needing to stay in the hospital due to flu. the flu vaccine also lowers your risk of dying of flu. flu vaccination is especially important because the flu and coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) cause similar symptoms. both covid-19 and the flu may be spreading at the same time. vaccination is the best way to protect against both. and if a covid-19 vaccine or booster and a flu vaccination are due at the same time, you can often get vaccinated for both in one visit. this year's seasonal flu vaccines each provide protection against the four influenza viruses expected to be the most common during this flu season. this year, the vaccine will be available as an injection and as a nasal spray. there also will be high-dose flu vaccines offered for adults age 65 and older. the nasal spray is approved for people between ages 2 and 49 years old. it isn't recommended for some groups, such as: people who had a severe allergic reaction to a flu vaccine in the past. pregnant people. children age 17 years or younger who are taking aspirin or a salicylate-containing medicine. people with weakened immune systems and caregivers or close contacts of people with weakened immune systems. children between ages 2 and 4 years old diagnosed with asthma or wheezing in the past 12 months. people who recently took antiviral medicine for the flu. people with a cerebrospinal fluid leak or the potential for a leak, as with a cochlear implant. if you have an egg allergy, you can still get a flu vaccine. controlling the spread of infectionthe influenza vaccine isn't 100% effective, so it's also important to take several measures to lower the spread of infection, including: wash your hands. wash your hands well and often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. if soap and water aren't available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. make sure friends and family that you're around regularly, especially kids, know the importance of hand-washing. avoid touching your face. keeping your hands away from your eyes, nose and mouth helps keep germs away from those places. cover your coughs and sneezes. cough or sneeze into a tissue or your elbow. then wash your hands. clean surfaces. regularly clean often-touched surfaces to prevent spread of infection from touching a surface with the virus on it and then your face. avoid crowds. the flu spreads easily wherever people gather \u2014 in child care centers, schools, office buildings and auditoriums and on public transportation. by avoiding crowds during peak flu season, you lower your chances of infection. also avoid anyone who is sick. and if you're sick, stay home for at least 24 hours after your fever is gone so that you lessen your chance of infecting others.more informationflu shotscold and flu viruses: how long can they live outside

come on suddenly. people who have flu often feel some or all of these symptoms: fever* or feeling feverish/chills cough sore throat runny or stuffy nose muscle or body aches headaches fatigue (tiredness) some people may have vomiting and diarrhea, though this is more common in children than adults. *it\u2019s important to note that not everyone with flu will have a fever. more information is available at flu and covid-19 symptoms. know the common symptoms of flulow resolution video this video includes common signs and symptoms of flu. flu complications most people who get flu will recover in a few days to less than two weeks, but some people will develop complications (such as pneumonia) as a result of flu, some of which can be life-threatening and result in death. sinus and ear infections are examples of moderate complications from flu, while pneumonia is a serious flu complication that can result from either flu virus infection alone or from co-infection of flu virus and bacteria. other possible serious complications triggered by flu can include inflammation of the heart (myocarditis), brain (encephalitis) or muscle tissues (myositis, rhabdomyolysis), and multi-organ failure (for example, respiratory and kidney failure). flu virus infection of the respiratory tract can trigger an extreme inflammatory response in the body and can lead to sepsis, the body\u2019s life-threatening response to infection. flu also can make chronic medical problems worse. for example, people with asthma may experience asthma attacks while they have flu, and people with chronic heart disease may experience a worsening of this condition triggered by flu. people at higher risk from flu anyone can get sick with flu, even healthy people, and serious problems related to flu can happen to anyone at any age, but some people are at higher risk of developing serious flu-related complications if they get sick. this includes people 65 years and older, people of any age

different viruses. covid-19 is caused by infection with a coronavirus named sars-cov-2, and flu is caused by infection with influenza viruses. you cannot tell the difference between flu and covid-19 by symptoms alone because some of the symptoms are the same. some pcr tests can differentiate between flu and covid-19 at the same time. if one of these tests is not available, many testing locations provide flu and covid-19 tests separately. talk to a healthcare provider about getting tested for both flu and covid-19 if you have symptoms. learn more other flu questions what is influenza? when is

antivirals if you:have had symptoms for under 48 hours. antivirals are less likely to work if you start them after two days of symptoms. the virus has already made more copies of itself and your body has started to fight it off with its own antibodies.have an underlying condition or are at risk for severe illness. providers may prescribe antivirals even if you\u2019ve had symptoms for longer than 48 hours.have severe symptoms, even if you\u2019ve been sick for longer than 48 hours.live with or care for people who are at risk for severe complications of the flu.what medications treat the flu?antiviral drugs for influenza include:oseltamivir phosphate (tamiflu\u00ae). you take oseltamivir by mouth as a pill or a liquid. you usually take it for several days.zanamivir (relenza\u00ae).

ones include nausea and diarrhea. inhaled medications can cause spasms that tighten and narrow your airways (bronchospasm).how do i manage symptoms of the flu?many people can manage the symptoms of flu at home with over-the-counter (otc) medications and other therapies, including:getting plenty of rest.drinking fluids like water or broth to help prevent dehydration.applying heat packs or hot water bottles can help with aching muscles.taking acetaminophen (tylenol\u00ae) or nsaids (advil\u00ae, motrin\u00ae, aleve\u00ae) can help lower your fever and relieve head and body aches.using spray or oral decongestants like phenylephrine or pseudoephedrine can help with a runny or stuffy nose.taking cough suppressants (antitussives) like dextromethorphan can help calm a nagging cough.using expectorants like guaifenesin make it easier to clear mucus out of your lungs.not everyone should take certain otcs, so check with your provider before you use them. it\u2019s also a good idea to make sure certain medications are okay to use together or with supplements. don\u2019t give aspirin to children under the age of 16 unless their provider says it\u2019s okay.care at cleveland clinicfind a primary care providerschedule an appointmentpreventionhow can i prevent the flu?the best way to prevent the flu is to get the flu vaccine every year. vaccines train your immune system to recognize infections and fight them off before you get sick. the influenza virus can change (mutate) a little bit every year, which is why you need to get vaccinated every year.even if you get sick with a different version of the flu than the one in the vaccine, vaccination reduces your risk of getting seriously ill. your provider can give you the flu vaccine as a shot or as a mist they spray into your nose.other ways to reduce your risk of getting the flu include:wash your hands often with soap and water. if you aren\u2019t able to use soap and water, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.cover your nose and mouth when you sneeze or cough. cough or sneeze into your elbow or a tissue rather than your bare hand.avoid being around other people when you or they are sick with the flu or other infectious diseases.consider wearing a mask if you\u2019re sick and can\u2019t avoid being around others.avoid touching your face, eyes, nose and mouth.don\u2019t share food or eating utensils (forks, spoons, cups) with others.outlook / prognosiswhat can i expect if i have the flu?most people are able to manage flu symptoms at home and recover within a few days to a week. because it can cause severe illness, it\u2019s important to keep an eye on your symptoms and get medical attention if you need it. this is especially important if you have an underlying health condition.if you\u2019re sick with the flu, you should avoid being around others, except to seek medical care.how long does the flu last?flu can last from a few days to two weeks. symptoms like fever and body aches can come on suddenly but usually go away faster than other symptoms. a cough or runny nose can last longer.how long is the flu contagious?you can be contagious with the flu from a day before your symptoms start to up to a week after. you\u2019re most contagious for three to four days after your symptoms start. people with weakened immune systems and infants may be contagious for longer.when can i go back to work/school?to avoid spreading the flu to others, you shouldn\u2019t go back to work or school until it\u2019s been at least 24 hours since you\u2019ve had a fever (without taking fever-reducing medications). your employer or school may have different requirements for returning.complicationsthe flu virus itself can cause complications or it can weaken your immune system and allow bacteria to infect different parts of your body (secondary infection). complications and secondary infections include:ear infections.sinus infections.severe lung infection (pneumonia). pneumonia can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) and other life-threatening conditions.pregnancy loss (miscarriage).neural tube defects (ntds) in the developing fetus of a pregnant person.how many people die from the flu each year?in a typical flu season in the u.s., it\u2019s estimated that between 20,000 and 50,000 people die from the flu. another 300,000 to 500,000 require hospitalization for serious illness.living withwhen should i see my healthcare provider?if you think you have the flu, it\u2019s important to get tested early on so that antiviral medications are most effective if your provider prescribes them. contact a healthcare provider right away if:you have flu symptoms and an underlying condition that puts you at higher risk for severe illness.your symptoms don\u2019t start to improve after seven to 10 days or if you have a fever lasting longer than three days.you\u2019re pregnant and have a fever or other flu symptoms.when should i go to er?go to the er or seek immediate medical attention if you have symptoms of severe illness, including:high fever (over 103 f/40 c).difficulty breathing.not peeing or peeing very little.pain in your chest or stomach (abdomen) that doesn\u2019t go away.persistent dizziness.confusion.severe muscle pain or weakness.seizures.bluish skin, lips or nails (cyanosis, which can be a sign of low oxygen levels in your blood or tissues).fever or cough that gets better or goes away but then get worse.worsening of other health conditions.what questions should i ask my doctor?how do i take my medication?what over-the-counter medications can i use?how do i treat my symptoms at home?what severe symptoms should i look out for?when should i go to the er?when should i follow up with you?how long might it take to feel better?additional common questionsis the stomach flu influenza?no, gastroenteritis, commonly called \u201cstomach flu,\u201d isn\u2019t caused by the influenza virus. it\u2019s not related to the seasonal flu.a note from cleveland clinicwhile the flu is very common, it\u2019s also important to remember that it can lead to life-threatening complications. getting your flu shot is the best way to avoid getting sick and protect your loved ones and neighbors, too. if you have underlying health conditions or are pregnant, talk to your provider about reducing your risk of flu. having the flu isn\u2019t fun for anyone, but most people can get through with some movies and chicken soup at home.medically reviewedlast reviewed by a cleveland clinic medical professional on 10/11/2022.learn more

drugs such as oseltamivirfrequency3\u20135 million severe cases per year[1][2]deaths>290,000\u2013650,000 deaths per year[3][4] influenza, commonly known as \"the flu\", is an infectious disease caused by influenza viruses. symptoms range from mild to severe and often include fever, runny nose, sore throat, muscle pain, headache, coughing, and fatigue. these symptoms begin from one to four days after exposure to the virus (typically two days) and last for about 2\u20138 days. diarrhea and vomiting can occur, particularly in children. influenza may progress to pneumonia, which can be caused by the virus or by a subsequent bacterial infection. other complications of infection include acute respiratory distress syndrome, meningitis, encephalitis, and worsening of pre-existing health problems such as asthma and cardiovascular disease. there are four types of influenza virus: a, b, c, and d. aquatic birds are the primary source of influenza a virus (iav), which is also widespread in various mammals, including humans and pigs. influenza b virus (ibv) and influenza c virus (icv) primarily infect humans, and influenza d virus (idv) is found in cattle and pigs. iav and ibv circulate in humans and cause seasonal epidemics, and icv causes a mild infection, primarily in children. idv can infect humans but is not known to cause illness. in humans, influenza viruses are primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets produced from coughing and sneezing. transmission through aerosols and intermediate objects and surfaces contaminated by the virus also occur. frequent hand washing and covering one's mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing reduce transmission. annual vaccination can help to provide protection against influenza. influenza viruses, particularly iav, evolve quickly, so flu vaccines are updated regularly to match which influenza strains are in circulation. vaccines provide protection against iav subtypes h1n1 and h3n2 and one or two ibv subtypes. influenza infection is diagnosed with laboratory methods such as antibody or antigen tests and a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) to identify viral nucleic acid. the disease can be treated with supportive measures and, in severe cases, with antiviral drugs such as oseltamivir. in healthy individuals, influenza is typically self-limiting and rarely fatal, but it can be deadly in high-risk groups. in a typical year, 5\u201315% of the population contracts influenza. there are 3\u20135 million severe cases annually, with up to 650,000 respiratory-related deaths globally each year. deaths most commonly occur in high-risk groups, including young children, the elderly, and people with chronic health conditions. in temperate regions of the world, the number of influenza cases peaks during winter, whereas in the tropics influenza can occur year-round. since the late 1800s, large outbreaks of novel influenza strains that spread globally, called pandemics, have occurred every 10\u201350 years. five flu pandemics have occurred since 1900: the spanish flu in 1918\u20131920, which was the most severe flu pandemic, the asian flu in 1957, the hong kong flu in 1968, the russian flu in 1977, and the swine flu pandemic in 2009. signs and symptoms symptoms of influenza,[5][6] with fever and cough the most common symptoms[7] the time between exposure to the virus and development of symptoms, called the incubation period, is 1\u20134 days, most commonly 1\u20132 days. many infections, however, are asymptomatic.[8] the onset of symptoms is sudden, and initial symptoms are predominately non-specific, including fever, chills, headaches, muscle pain or aching, a feeling of discomfort, loss of appetite, lack of energy/fatigue, and confusion. these symptoms are usually accompanied by respiratory symptoms such as a dry cough, sore or dry throat, hoarse voice, and a stuffy or runny nose. coughing is the most common symptom.[1] gastrointestinal symptoms may also occur, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,[9] and gastroenteritis,[10] especially in children. the standard influenza symptoms typically last for 2\u20138 days.[11] a 2021 study suggests influenza can cause long lasting symptoms in a similar way to long covid.[12] symptomatic infections are usually mild and limited to the upper respiratory tract, but progression to pneumonia is relatively common. pneumonia may be caused by the primary viral infection or by a secondary bacterial infection. primary pneumonia is characterized by rapid progression of fever, cough, labored breathing, and low oxygen levels that cause bluish skin. it is especially common among those who have an underlying cardiovascular disease such as rheumatic heart disease. secondary pneumonia typically has a period of improvement in symptoms for 1\u20133 weeks[13] followed by recurrent fever, sputum production, and fluid buildup in the lungs,[1] but can also occur just a few days after influenza symptoms appear.[13] about a third of primary pneumonia cases are followed by secondary pneumonia, which is most frequently caused by the bacteria streptococcus pneumoniae and staphylococcus aureus.[8][1] virology types of virus influenza virus nomenclature (for a fujian flu virus) influenza viruses comprise four species. each of the four species is the sole member of its own genus, and the four influenza genera comprise four of the seven genera in the family orthomyxoviridae. they are:[1][14] influenza a virus (iav), genus alphainfluenzavirus influenza b virus (ibv), genus betainfluenzavirus influenza c virus (icv), genus gammainfluenzavirus influenza d virus (idv), genus deltainfluenzavirus iav is responsible for most cases of severe illness as well as seasonal epidemics and occasional pandemics. it infects people of all ages but tends to disproportionately cause severe illness in the elderly, the very young, and those who have chronic health issues. birds are the primary reservoir of iav, especially aquatic birds such as ducks, geese, shorebirds, and gulls,[15][16] but the virus also circulates among mammals, including pigs, horses, and marine mammals. iav is classified into subtypes based on the viral proteins haemagglutinin (h) and neuraminidase (n).[17] as of 2019, 18 h subtypes and 11 n subtypes have been identified. most potential combinations have been reported in birds, but h17-18 and n10-11 have only been found in bats. only h subtypes h1-3 and n subtypes n1-2 are known to have circulated in humans.[17] the iav subtypes in circulation as of 2018[update] are h1n1 and h3n2.[2] iavs can be classified more specifically by natural host species, geographical origin, year of isolation, and strain number, such as h1n1/a/duck/alberta/35/76.[1][9] ibv mainly infects humans but has been identified in seals, horses, dogs, and pigs.[17] ibv does not have subtypes like iav but has two antigenically distinct lineages, termed the b/victoria/2/1987-like and b/yamagata/16/1988-like lineages,[1] or simply (b/)victoria(-like) and (b/)yamagata(-like).[17][2] both lineages are in circulation in humans,[1] disproportionately affecting children.[9] ibvs contribute to seasonal epidemics alongside iavs but have never been associated with a pandemic.[17] icv, like ibv, is primarily found in humans, though it also has been detected in pigs, feral dogs, dromedary camels, cattle, and dogs.[10][17] icv infection primarily affects children and is usually asymptomatic[1][9] or has mild cold-like symptoms, though more severe symptoms such as gastroenteritis and pneumonia can occur.[10] unlike iav and ibv, icv has not been a major focus of research pertaining to antiviral drugs, vaccines, and other measures against influenza.[17] icv is subclassified into six genetic/antigenic lineages.[10][18] idv has been isolated from pigs and cattle, the latter being the natural reservoir. infection has also been observed in humans, horses, dromedary camels, and small ruminants such as goats and sheep.[17][18] idv is distantly related to icv. while cattle workers have occasionally tested positive to prior idv infection, it is not known to cause disease in humans.[1][9][10] icv and idv experience a slower rate of antigenic evolution than iav and ibv. because of this antigenic stability, relatively few novel lineages emerge.[18] genome and structure structure of the influenza virion. the hemagglutinin (ha) and neuraminidase (na) proteins are shown on the surface of the particle. the viral rnas that make up the genome are shown as red coils inside the particle and bound to ribonucleoproteins (rnp). influenza viruses have a negative-sense, single-stranded rna genome that is segmented. the negative sense of the genome means it can be used as a template to synthesize messenger rna (mrna).[8] iav and ibv have eight genome segments that encode 10 major proteins. icv and idv have seven genome segments that encode nine major proteins.[10] three segments encode three subunits of an rna-dependent rna polymerase (rdrp) complex: pb1, a transcriptase, pb2, which recognizes 5' caps, and pa (p3 for icv and idv), an endonuclease.[19] the matrix protein (m1) and membrane protein (m2) share a segment, as do the non-structural protein (ns1) and the nuclear export protein (nep).[1] for iav and ibv, hemagglutinin (ha) and neuraminidase (na) are encoded on one segment each, whereas icv and idv encode a hemagglutinin-esterase fusion (hef) protein on one segment that merges the functions of ha and na. the final genome segment encodes the viral nucleoprotein (np).[19] influenza viruses also encode various accessory proteins, such as pb1-f2 and pa-x, that are expressed through alternative open reading frames[1][20] and which are important in host defense suppression, virulence, and pathogenicity.[21] the virus particle, called a virion, is pleomorphic and varies between being filamentous, bacilliform, or spherical in shape. clinical isolates tend to be pleomorphic, whereas strains adapted to laboratory growth typically produce spherical virions. filamentous virions are about 250 nanometers (nm) by 80 nm, bacilliform 120\u2013250 by 95 nm, and spherical 120 nm in diameter.[22] the virion consists of each segment of the genome bound to nucleoproteins in separate ribonucleoprotein (rnp) complexes for each segment, all of which are surrounded by a lipid bilayer membrane called the viral envelope. there is a copy of the rdrp, all subunits included, bound to each rnp. the envelope is reinforced structurally by matrix proteins on the interior that enclose the rnps,[3] and the envelope contains ha and na (or hef[18]) proteins extending outward from the exterior surface of the envelope. ha and hef[18] proteins have a distinct \"head\" and \"stalk\" structure. m2 proteins form proton ion channels through the viral envelope that are required for viral entry and exit. ibvs contain a surface protein named nb that is anchored in the envelope, but its function is unknown.[1] life cycle host cell invasion and replication by the influenza virus the viral life cycle begins by binding to a target cell. binding is mediated by the viral ha proteins on the surface of the envelope, which bind to cells that contain sialic acid receptors on the surface of the cell membrane.[1][15][3] for n1 subtypes with the \"g147r\" mutation and n2 subtypes, the na protein can initiate entry. prior to binding, na proteins promote access to target cells by degrading mucus, which helps to remove extracellular decoy receptors that would impede access to target cells.[3] after binding, the virus is internalized into the cell by an endosome that contains the virion inside it. the endosome is acidified by cellular vatpase[20] to have lower ph, which triggers a conformational change in ha that allows fusion of the viral envelope with the endosomal membrane.[21] at the same time, hydrogen ions diffuse into the virion through m2 ion channels, disrupting internal protein-protein interactions to release rnps into the host cell's cytosol. the m1 protein shell surrounding rnps is degraded, fully uncoating rnps in the cytosol.[20][3] rnps are then imported into the nucleus with the help of viral localization signals. there, the viral rna polymerase transcribes mrna using the genomic negative-sense strand as a template. the polymerase snatches 5' caps for viral mrna from cellular rna to prime mrna synthesis and the 3'-end of mrna is polyadenylated at the end of transcription.[19] once viral mrna is transcribed, it is exported out of the nucleus and translated by host ribosomes in a cap-dependent manner to synthesize viral proteins.[20] rdrp also synthesizes complementary positive-sense strands of the viral genome in a complementary rnp complex which are then used as templates by viral polymerases to synthesize copies of the negative-sense genome.[1][3] during these processes, rdrps of avian influenza viruses (aivs) function optimally at a higher temperature than mammalian influenza viruses.[11] newly synthesized viral polymerase subunits and np proteins are imported to the nucleus to further increase the rate of viral replication and form rnps.[19] ha, na, and m2 proteins are trafficked with the aid of m1 and nep proteins[21] to the cell membrane through the golgi apparatus[19] and inserted into the cell's membrane. viral non-structural proteins including ns1, pb1-f2, and pa-x regulate host cellular processes to disable antiviral responses.[1][21][3] pb1-f2 also interacts with pb1 to keep polymerases in the nucleus longer.[16] m1 and nep proteins localize to the nucleus during the later stages of infection, bind to viral rnps and mediate their export to the cytoplasm where they migrate to the cell membrane with the aid of recycled endosomes and are bundled into the segments of the genome.[1][3] progeny viruses leave the cell by budding from the cell membrane, which is initiated by the accumulation of m1 proteins at the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. the viral genome is incorporated inside a viral envelope derived from portions of the cell membrane that have ha, na, and m2 proteins. at the end of budding, ha proteins remain attached to cellular sialic acid until they are cleaved by the sialidase activity of na proteins. the virion is then released from the cell. the sialidase activity of na also cleaves any sialic acid residues from the viral surface, which helps prevent newly assembled viruses from aggregating near the cell surface and improving infectivity.[1][3] similar to other aspects of influenza replication, optimal na activity is temperature- and ph-dependent.[11] ultimately, presence of large quantities of viral rna in the cell triggers apoptosis, i.e. programmed cell death, which is initiated by cellular factors to restrict viral replication.[20] antigenic drift and shift antigenic shift, or reassortment, can result in novel and highly pathogenic strains of human influenza.[23] two key processes that influenza viruses evolve through are antigenic drift and antigenic shift. antigenic drift is when an influenza virus' antigens change due to the gradual accumulation of mutations in the antigen's (ha or na) gene.[15] this can occur in response to evolutionary pressure exerted by the host immune response. antigenic drift is especially common for the ha protein, in which just a few amino acid changes in the head region can constitute antigenic drift.[2][18] the result is the production of novel strains that can evade pre-existing antibody-mediated immunity.[1][9] antigenic drift occurs in all influenza species but is slower in b than a and slowest in c and d.[18] antigenic drift is a major cause of seasonal influenza,[24] and requires that flu vaccines be updated annually. ha is the main component of inactivated vaccines, so surveillance monitors antigenic drift of this antigen among circulating strains. antigenic evolution of influenza viruses of humans appears to be faster than influenza viruses in swine and equines. in wild birds, within-subtype antigenic variation appears to be limited but has been observed in poultry.[1][9] antigenic shift is a sudden, drastic change in an influenza virus' antigen, usually ha. during antigenic shift, antigenically different strains that infect the same cell can reassort genome segments with each other, producing hybrid progeny. since all influenza viruses have segmented genomes, all are capable of reassortment.[10][18] antigenic shift, however, only occurs among influenza viruses of the same genus[19] and most commonly occurs among iavs. in particular, reassortment is very common in aivs, creating a large diversity of influenza viruses in birds, but is uncommon in human, equine, and canine lineages.[25] pigs, bats, and quails have receptors for both mammalian and avian iavs, so they are potential \"mixing vessels\" for reassortment.[17] if an animal strain reassorts with a human strain,[2] then a novel strain can emerge that is capable of human-to-human transmission. this has caused pandemics, but only a limited number have occurred, so it is difficult to predict when the next will happen.[1][9] mechanism transmission people who are infected can transmit influenza viruses through breathing, talking, coughing, and sneezing, which spread respiratory droplets and aerosols that contain virus particles into the air. a person susceptible to infection can then contract influenza by coming into contact with these particles.[13][26] respiratory droplets are relatively large and travel less than two meters before falling onto nearby surfaces. aerosols are smaller and remain suspended in the air longer, so they take longer to settle and can travel further than respiratory droplets.[26][4] inhalation of aerosols can lead to infection,[27] but most transmission is in the area about two meters around an infected person via respiratory droplets[8] that come into contact with mucosa of the upper respiratory tract.[27] transmission through contact with a person, bodily fluids, or intermediate objects (fomites) can also occur, such as through contaminated hands and surfaces[8][26] since influenza viruses can survive for hours on non-porous surfaces.[4] if one's hands are contaminated, then touching one's face can cause infection.[28] influenza is usually transmissible from one day before the onset of symptoms to 5\u20137 days after.[9] in healthy adults, the virus is shed for up to 3\u20135 days. in children and the immunocompromised, the virus may be transmissible for several weeks.[8] children ages 2\u201317 are considered to be the primary and most efficient spreaders of influenza.[1][9] children who have not had multiple prior exposures to influenza viruses shed the virus at greater quantities and for a longer duration than other children.[1] people who are at risk of exposure to influenza include health care workers, social care workers, and those who live with or care for people vulnerable to influenza. in long-term care facilities, the flu can spread rapidly after it is introduced.[9] a variety of factors likely encourage influenza transmission, including lower temperature, lower absolute and relative humidity, less ultraviolet radiation from the sun,[27][29] and crowding.[26] influenza viruses that infect the upper respiratory tract like h1n1 tend to be more mild but more transmissible, whereas those that infect the lower respiratory tract like h5n1 tend to cause more severe illness but are less contagious.[8] pathophysiology how the different sites of infection (shown in red) of h1n1 and h5n1 influences their transmission and lethality[23] in humans, influenza viruses first cause infection by infecting epithelial cells in the respiratory tract. illness during infection is primarily the result of lung inflammation and compromise caused by epithelial cell infection and death, combined with inflammation caused by the immune system's response to infection. non-respiratory organs can become involved, but the mechanisms by which influenza is involved in these cases are unknown. severe respiratory illness can be caused by multiple, non-exclusive mechanisms, including obstruction of the airways, loss of alveolar structure, loss of lung epithelial integrity due to epithelial cell infection and death, and degradation of the extracellular matrix that maintains lung structure. in particular, alveolar cell infection appears to drive severe symptoms since this results in impaired gas exchange and enables viruses to infect endothelial cells, which produce large quantities of pro-inflammatory cytokines.[13] pneumonia caused by influenza viruses is characterized by high levels of viral replication in the lower respiratory tract, accompanied by a strong pro-inflammatory response called a cytokine storm.[1] infection with h5n1 or h7n9 especially produces high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines.[15] in bacterial infections, early depletion of macrophages during influenza creates a favorable environment in the lungs for bacterial growth since these white blood cells are important in responding to bacterial infection. host mechanisms to encourage tissue repair may inadvertently allow bacterial infection. infection also induces production of systemic glucocorticoids that can reduce inflammation to preserve tissue integrity but allow increased bacterial growth.[13] the pathophysiology of influenza is significantly influenced by which receptors influenza viruses bind to during entry into cells. mammalian influenza viruses preferentially bind to sialic acids connected to the rest of the oligosaccharide by an \u03b1-2,6 link, most commonly found in various respiratory cells,[1][15][3] such as respiratory and retinal epithelial cells.[20] aivs prefer sialic acids with an \u03b1-2,3 linkage, which are most common in birds in gastrointestinal epithelial cells[1][15][3] and in humans in the lower respiratory tract.[30] furthermore, cleavage of the ha protein into ha1, the binding subunit, and ha2, the fusion subunit, is performed by different proteases, affecting which cells can be infected. for mammalian influenza viruses and low pathogenic aivs, cleavage is extracellular, which limits infection to cells that have the appropriate proteases, whereas for highly pathogenic aivs, cleavage is intracellular and performed by ubiquitous proteases, which allows for infection of a greater variety of cells, thereby contributing to more severe disease.[1][25][31] immunology cells possess sensors to detect viral rna, which can then induce interferon production. interferons mediate expression of antiviral proteins and proteins that recruit immune cells to the infection site, and they also notify nearby uninfected cells of infection. some infected cells release pro-inflammatory cytokines that recruit immune cells to the site of infection. immune cells control viral infection by killing infected cells and phagocytizing viral particles and apoptotic cells. an exacerbated immune response, however, can harm the host organism through a cytokine storm.[1][11][20] to counter the immune response, influenza viruses encode various non-structural proteins, including ns1, nep, pb1-f2, and pa-x, that are involved in curtailing the host immune response by suppressing interferon production and host gene expression.[1][21] b cells, a type of white blood cell, produce antibodies that bind to influenza antigens ha and na (or hef[18]) and other proteins to a lesser degree. once bound to these proteins, antibodies block virions from binding to cellular receptors, neutralizing the virus. in humans, a sizeable antibody response occurs ~1 week after viral exposure.[32] this antibody response is typically robust and long-lasting, especially for icv and idv.[1][18] in other words, people exposed to a certain strain in childhood still possess antibodies to that strain at a reasonable level later in life, which can provide some protection to related strains.[1] there is, however, an \"original antigenic sin\", in which the first ha subtype a person is exposed to influences the antibody-based immune response to future infections and vaccines.[2] prevention further information: influenza prevention vaccination main article: influenza vaccine giving an influenza vaccination annual vaccination is the primary and most effective way to prevent influenza and influenza-associated complications, especially for high-risk groups.[8][1][33] vaccines against the flu are trivalent or quadrivalent, providing protection against an h1n1 strain, an h3n2 strain, and one or two ibv strains corresponding to the two ibv lineages.[8][2] two types of vaccines are in use: inactivated vaccines that contain \"killed\" (i.e. inactivated) viruses and live attenuated influenza vaccines (laivs) that contain weakened viruses.[1] there are three types of inactivated vaccines: whole virus, split virus, in which the virus is disrupted by a detergent, and subunit, which only contains the viral antigens ha and na.[34] most flu vaccines are inactivated and administered via intramuscular injection. laivs are sprayed into the nasal cavity.[1] vaccination recommendations vary by country. some recommend vaccination for all people above a certain age, such as 6 months,[33] whereas other countries recommendation is limited for high at risk groups, such as pregnant women, young children (excluding newborns), the elderly, people with chronic medical conditions, health care workers,[1] people who come into contact with high-risk people, and people who transmit the virus easily.[9] young infants cannot receive flu vaccines for safety reasons, but they can inherit passive immunity from their mother if inactivated vaccines are administered to the mother during pregnancy.[35] influenza vaccination also helps to reduce the probability of reassortment.[11] an influenza a&b antigen test(bottom) showing negative results for both influenza a and b) in general, influenza vaccines are only effective if there is an antigenic match between vaccine strains and circulating strains.[8][2] additionally, most commercially available flu vaccines are manufactured by propagation of influenza viruses in embryonated chicken eggs, taking 6\u20138 months.[2] flu seasons are different in the northern and southern hemisphere, so the who meets twice a year, one for each hemisphere, to discuss which strains should be included in flu vaccines based on observation from ha inhibition assays.[8][3] other manufacturing methods include an mdck cell culture-based inactivated vaccine and a recombinant subunit vaccine manufactured from baculovirus overexpression in insect cells.[2][36] antiviral chemoprophylaxis influenza can be prevented or reduced in severity by post-exposure prophylaxis with the antiviral drugs oseltamivir, which can be taken orally by those at least three months old, and zanamivir, which can be inhaled by those above seven years of age. chemoprophylaxis is most useful for individuals at high-risk of developing complications and those who cannot receive the flu vaccine due to contraindications or lack of effectiveness.[8] post-exposure chemoprophylaxis is only recommended if oseltamivir is taken within 48 hours of contact with a confirmed or suspected influenza case and zanamivir within 36 hours.[8][9] it is recommended that it be offered to people who have yet to receive a vaccine for the current flu season, who have been vaccinated less than two week since contact, if there is a significant mismatch between vaccine and circulating strains, or during an outbreak in a closed setting regardless of vaccination history.[9] infection control hand hygiene is important in reducing the spread of influenza. this includes frequent hand washing with soap and water, using alcohol-based hand sanitizers, and not touching one's eyes, nose, and mouth with one's hands. covering one's nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing is important.[37] other methods to limit influenza transmission include staying home when sick,[1] avoiding contact with others until one day after symptoms end,[9] and disinfecting surfaces likely to be contaminated by the virus, such as doorknobs.[1] health education through media and posters is often used to remind people of the aforementioned etiquette and hygiene.[8] there is uncertainty about the use of masks since research thus far has not shown a significant reduction in seasonal influenza with mask usage. likewise, the effectiveness of screening at points of entry into countries is not well researched.[37] social distancing measures such as school closures, avoiding contact with infected people via isolation or quarantine, and limiting mass gatherings may reduce transmission,[1][37] but these measures are often expensive, unpopular, and difficult to implement. consequently, the commonly recommended methods of infection control are respiratory etiquette, hand hygiene, and mask wearing, which are inexpensive and easy to perform. pharmaceutical measures are effective but may not be available in the early stages of an outbreak.[38] in health care settings, infected individuals may be cohorted or assigned to individual rooms. protective clothing such as masks, gloves, and gowns is recommended when coming into contact with infected individuals if there is a risk of exposure to infected bodily fluids. keeping patients in negative pressure rooms and avoiding aerosol-producing activities may help,[8] but special air handling and ventilation systems are not considered necessary to prevent the spread of influenza in the air.[4] in residential homes, new admissions may need to be closed until the spread of influenza is controlled. when discharging patients to care homes, it is important to take care if there is a known influenza outbreak.[9] since influenza viruses circulate in animals such as birds and pigs, prevention of transmission from these animals is important. water treatment, indoor raising of animals, quarantining sick animals, vaccination, and biosecurity are the primary measures used. placing poultry houses and piggeries on high ground away from high-density farms, backyard farms, live poultry markets, and bodies of water helps to minimize contact with wild birds.[1] closure of live poultry markets appears to the most effective measure[15] and has shown to be effective at controlling the spread of h5n1, h7n9, and h9n2.[16] other biosecurity measures include cleaning and disinfecting facilities and vehicles, banning visits to poultry farms, not bringing birds intended for slaughter back to farms,[39] changing clothes, disinfecting foot baths, and treating food and water.[1] if live poultry markets are not closed, then \"clean days\" when unsold poultry is removed and facilities are disinfected and \"no carry-over\" policies to eliminate infectious material before new poultry arrive can be used to reduce the spread of influenza viruses. if a novel influenza viruses has breached the aforementioned biosecurity measures, then rapid detection to stamp it out via quarantining, decontamination, and culling may be necessary to prevent the virus from becoming endemic.[1] vaccines exist for avian h5, h7, and h9 subtypes that are used in some countries.[15] in china, for example, vaccination of domestic birds against h7n9 successfully limited its spread, indicating that vaccination may be an effective strategy[25] if used in combination with other measures to limit transmission.[1] in pigs and horses, management of influenza is dependent on vaccination with biosecurity.[1] diagnosis x-ray of 29-year-old person with h1n1 diagnosis based on symptoms is fairly accurate in otherwise healthy people during seasonal epidemics and should be suspected in cases of pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards), sepsis, or if encephalitis, myocarditis, or breaking down of muscle tissue occur.[13] because influenza is similar to other viral respiratory tract illnesses, laboratory diagnosis is necessary for confirmation. common ways of collecting samples for testing include nasal and throat swabs.[1] samples may be taken from the lower respiratory tract if infection has cleared the upper but not lower respiratory tract. influenza testing is recommended for anyone hospitalized with symptoms resembling influenza during flu season or who is connected to an influenza case. for severe cases, earlier diagnosis improves patient outcome.[33] diagnostic methods that can identify influenza include viral cultures, antibody- and antigen-detecting tests, and nucleic acid-based tests.[40] viruses can be grown in a culture of mammalian cells or embryonated eggs for 3\u201310 days to monitor cytopathic effect. final confirmation can then be done via antibody staining, hemadsorption using red blood cells, or immunofluorescence microscopy. shell vial cultures, which can identify infection via immunostaining before a cytopathic effect appears, are more sensitive than traditional cultures with results in 1\u20133 days.[1][33][40] cultures can be used to characterize novel viruses, observe sensitivity to antiviral drugs, and monitor antigenic drift, but they are relatively slow and require specialized skills and equipment.[1] serological assays can be used to detect an antibody response to influenza after natural infection or vaccination. common serological assays include hemagglutination inhibition assays that detect ha-specific antibodies, virus neutralization assays that check whether antibodies have neutralized the virus, and enzyme-linked immunoabsorbant assays. these methods tend to be relatively inexpensive and fast but are less reliable than nucleic-acid based tests.[1][40] direct fluorescent or immunofluorescent antibody (dfa/ifa) tests involve staining respiratory epithelial cells in samples with fluorescently-labeled influenza-specific antibodies, followed by examination under a fluorescent microscope. they can differentiate between iav and ibv but can not subtype iav.[40] rapid influenza diagnostic tests (ridts) are a simple way of obtaining assay results, are low cost, and produce results quickly, at less than 30 minutes, so they are commonly used, but they can not distinguish between iav and ibv or between iav subtypes and are not as sensitive as nucleic-acid based tests.[1][40] nucleic acid-based tests (nats) amplify and detect viral nucleic acid. most of these tests take a few hours,[40] but rapid molecular assays are as fast as ridts.[33] among nats, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) is the most traditional and considered the gold standard for diagnosing influenza[40] because it is fast and can subtype iav, but it is relatively expensive and more prone to false-positives than cultures.[1] other nats that have been used include loop-mediated isothermal amplification-based assays, simple amplification-based assays, and nucleic acid sequence-based amplification. nucleic acid sequencing methods can identify infection by obtaining the nucleic acid sequence of viral samples to identify the virus and antiviral drug resistance. the traditional method is sanger sequencing, but it has been largely replaced by next-generation methods that have greater sequencing speed and throughput.[40] treatment main article: influenza treatment treatment of influenza in cases of mild or moderate illness is supportive and includes anti-fever medications such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen,[41] adequate fluid intake to avoid dehydration, and resting at home.[9] cough drops and throat sprays may be beneficial for sore throat. it is recommended to avoid alcohol and tobacco use while sick with the flu.[41] aspirin is not recommended to treat influenza in children due to an elevated risk of developing reye syndrome.[42] corticosteroids likewise are not recommended except when treating septic shock or an underlying medical condition, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma exacerbation, since they are associated with increased mortality.[33] if a secondary bacterial infection occurs, then treatment with antibiotics may be necessary.[9] antivirals antiviral drugs[11] drug route of administration approved age of use oseltamivir oral at least two weeks old zanamivir inhalation at least five years old peramivir intravenous injection at least 18 years old laninamivir inhalation[1] 40 milligrams (mg) dose for people at least 10 years old, 20 mg for those under 10[43] baloxavir marboxil oral[4] at least 12 years old[33] antiviral drugs are primarily used to treat severely ill patients, especially those with compromised immune systems. antivirals are most effective when started in the first 48 hours after symptoms appear. later administration may still be beneficial for those who have underlying immune defects, those with more severe symptoms, or those who have a higher risk of developing complications if these individuals are still shedding the virus. antiviral treatment is also recommended if a person is hospitalized with suspected influenza instead of waiting for test results to return and if symptoms are worsening.[1][33] most antiviral drugs against influenza fall into two categories: neuraminidase (na) inhibitors and m2 inhibitors.[11] baloxavir marboxil is a notable exception, which targets the endonuclease activity of the viral rna polymerase and can be used as an alternative to na and m2 inhibitors for iav and ibv.[8][15][4] na inhibitors target the enzymatic activity of na receptors, mimicking the binding of sialic acid in the active site of na on iav and ibv virions[1] so that viral release from infected cells and the rate of viral replication are impaired.[9] na inhibitors include oseltamivir, which is consumed orally in a prodrug form and converted to its active form in the liver, and zanamivir, which is a powder that is inhaled nasally. oseltamivir and zanamivir are effective for prophylaxis and post-exposure prophylaxis, and research overall indicates that na inhibitors are effective at reducing rates of complications, hospitalization, and mortality[1] and the duration of illness.[11][33][4] additionally, the earlier na inhibitors are provided, the better the outcome,[4] though late administration can still be beneficial in severe cases.[1][33] other na inhibitors include laninamivir[1] and peramivir, the latter of which can be used as an alternative to oseltamivir for people who cannot tolerate or absorb it.[33] the adamantanes amantadine and rimantadine are orally administered drugs that block the influenza virus' m2 ion channel,[1] preventing viral uncoating.[4] these drugs are only functional against iav[33] but are no longer recommended for use because of widespread resistance to them among iavs.[4] adamantane resistance first emerged in h3n2 in 2003, becoming worldwide by 2008. oseltamivir resistance is no longer widespread because the 2009 pandemic h1n1 strain (h1n1 pdm09), which is resistant to adamantanes, seemingly replaced resistant strains in circulation. since the 2009 pandemic, oseltamivir resistance has mainly been observed in patients undergoing therapy,[1] especially the immunocompromised and young children.[4] oseltamivir resistance is usually reported in h1n1, but has been reported in h3n2 and ibvs less commonly.[1] because of this, oseltamivir is recommended as the first drug of choice for immunocompetent people, whereas for the immunocompromised, oseltamivir is recommended against h3n2 and ibv and zanamivir against h1n1 pdm09. zanamivir resistance is observed less frequently, and resistance to peramivir and baloxavir marboxil is possible.[4] prognosis in healthy individuals, influenza infection is usually self-limiting and rarely fatal.[8][9] symptoms usually last for 2\u20138 days.[11] influenza can cause people to miss work or school, and it is associated with decreased job performance and, in older adults, reduced independence. fatigue and malaise may last for several weeks after recovery, and healthy adults may experience pulmonary abnormalities that can take several weeks to resolve. complications and mortality primarily occur in high-risk populations and those who are hospitalized. severe disease and mortality are usually attributable to pneumonia from the primary viral infection or a secondary bacterial infection,[1][9] which can progress to ards.[11] other respiratory complications that may occur include sinusitis, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, excess fluid buildup in the lungs, and exacerbation of chronic bronchitis and asthma. middle ear infection and croup may occur, most commonly in children.[8][1] secondary s. aureus infection has been observed, primarily in children, to cause toxic shock syndrome after influenza, with hypotension, fever, and reddening and peeling of the skin.[1] complications affecting the cardiovascular system are rare and include pericarditis, fulminant myocarditis with a fast, slow, or irregular heartbeat, and exacerbation of pre-existing cardiovascular disease.[8][9] inflammation or swelling of muscles accompanied by muscle tissue breaking down occurs rarely, usually in children, which presents as extreme tenderness and muscle pain in the legs and a reluctance to walk for 2\u20133 days.[1][9][13] influenza can affect pregnancy, including causing smaller neonatal size, increased risk of premature birth, and an increased risk of child death shortly before or after birth.[9] neurological complications have been associated with influenza on rare occasions, including aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, disseminated encephalomyelitis, transverse myelitis, and guillain\u2013barr\u00e9 syndrome.[13] additionally, febrile seizures and reye syndrome can occur, most commonly in children.[1][9] influenza-associated encephalopathy can occur directly from central nervous system infection from the presence of the virus in blood and presents as sudden onset of fever with convulsions, followed by rapid progression to coma.[8] an atypical form of encephalitis called encephalitis lethargica, characterized by headache, drowsiness, and coma, may rarely occur sometime after infection.[1] in survivors of influenza-associated encephalopathy, neurological defects may occur.[8] primarily in children, in severe cases the immune system may rarely dramatically overproduce white blood cells that release cytokines, causing severe inflammation.[8] people who are at least 65 years of age,[9] due to a weakened immune system from aging or a chronic illness, are a high-risk group for developing complications, as are children less than one year of age and children who have not been previously exposed to influenza viruses multiple times. pregnant women are at an elevated risk, which increases by trimester[1] and lasts up to two weeks after childbirth.[9][33] obesity, in particular a body mass index greater than 35\u201340, is associated with greater amounts of viral replication, increased severity of secondary bacterial infection, and reduced vaccination efficacy. people who have underlying health conditions are also considered at-risk, including those who have congenital or chronic heart problems or lung (e.g. asthma), kidney, liver, blood, neurological, or metabolic (e.g. diabetes) disorders,[8][1][9] as are people who are immunocompromised from chemotherapy, asplenia, prolonged steroid treatment, splenic dysfunction, or hiv infection.[9] tobacco use, including past use, places a person at risk.[33] the role of genetics in influenza is not well researched,[1] but it may be a factor in influenza mortality.[11] epidemiology further information: flu season and flu pandemics influenza mortality in symptomatic cases in the us for the 2018/2019 season.[44] influenza is typically characterized by seasonal epidemics and sporadic pandemics. most of the burden of influenza is a result of flu seasons caused by iav and ibv. among iav subtypes, h1n1 and h3n2 circulate in humans and are responsible for seasonal influenza. cases disproportionately occur in children, but most severe causes are among the elderly, the very young,[1] and the immunocompromised.[4] in a typical year, influenza viruses infect 5\u201315% of the global population,[3][40] causing 3\u20135 million cases of severe illness annually[1][2] and accounting for 290,000\u2013650,000 deaths each year due to respiratory illness.[3][4][45] 5\u201310% of adults and 20\u201330% of children contract influenza each year.[17] the reported number of influenza cases is usually much lower than the actual number of cases.[1][35] during seasonal epidemics, it is estimated that about 80% of otherwise healthy people who have a cough or sore throat have the flu.[1] approximately 30\u201340% of people hospitalized for influenza develop pneumonia, and about 5% of all severe pneumonia cases in hospitals are due to influenza, which is also the most common cause of ards in adults. in children, influenza is one of the two most common causes of ards, the other being the respiratory syncytial virus.[13] about 3\u20135% of children each year develop otitis media due to influenza.[8] adults who develop organ failure from influenza and children who have pim scores and acute renal failure have higher rates of mortality.[13] during seasonal influenza, mortality is concentrated in the very young and the elderly, whereas during flu pandemics, young adults are often affected at a high rate.[11] seasonal risk areas for influenza: november\u2013april (blue), april\u2013november (red), and year-round (yellow) in temperate regions, the number of influenza cases varies from season to season. lower vitamin d levels, presumably due to less sunlight,[29] lower humidity, lower temperature, and minor changes in virus proteins caused by antigenic drift contribute to annual epidemics that peak during the winter season. in the northern hemisphere, this is from october to may (more narrowly december to april[11]), and in the southern hemisphere, this is from may to october (more narrowly june to september[11]). there are therefore two distinct influenza seasons every year in temperate regions, one in the northern hemisphere and one in the southern hemisphere.[1][9][2] in tropical and subtropical regions, seasonality is more complex and appears to be affected by various climatic factors such as minimum temperature, hours of sunshine, maximum rainfall, and high humidity.[1][46] influenza may therefore occur year-round in these regions.[11] influenza epidemics in modern times have the tendency to start in the eastern or southern hemisphere,[46] with asia being a key reservoir of influenza viruses.[11] iav and ibv co-circulate, so the two have the same patterns of transmission.[1] the seasonality of icv, however, is poorly understood. icv infection is most common in children under the age of two, and by adulthood most people have been exposed to it. icv-associated hospitalization most commonly occurs in children under the age of three and is frequently accompanied by co-infection with another virus or a bacterium, which may increase the severity of disease. when considering all hospitalizations for respiratory illness among young children, icv appears to account for only a small percentage of such cases. large outbreaks of icv infection can occur, so incidence varies significantly.[10] outbreaks of influenza caused by novel influenza viruses are common.[19] depending on the level of pre-existing immunity in the population, novel influenza viruses can spread rapidly and cause pandemics with millions of deaths. these pandemics, in contrast to seasonal influenza, are caused by antigenic shifts involving animal influenza viruses. to date, all known flu pandemics have been caused by iavs, and they follow the same pattern of spreading from an origin point to the rest of the world over the course of multiple waves in a year.[1][9][33] pandemic strains tend to be associated with higher rates of pneumonia in otherwise healthy individuals.[13] generally after each influenza pandemic, the pandemic strain continues to circulate as the cause of seasonal influenza, replacing prior strains.[1] from 1700 to 1889, influenza pandemics occurred about once every 50\u201360 years. since then, pandemics have occurred about once every 10\u201350 years, so they may be getting more frequent over time.[46] history the main types of influenza viruses in humans. solid squares show the appearance of a new strain, causing recurring influenza pandemics. broken lines indicate uncertain strain identifications.[47] it is impossible to know when an influenza virus first infected humans or when the first influenza pandemic occurred.[48] the first influenza epidemic may have occurred around 6,000 bc in china,[49] and possible descriptions of influenza exist in greek writings from the 5th century bc.[46][50] in both 1173\u20131174 ad and 1387 ad, epidemics occurred across europe that were named \"influenza\". whether these epidemics or others were caused by influenza is unclear since there was then no consistent naming pattern for epidemic respiratory diseases, and \"influenza\" did not become clearly associated with respiratory disease until centuries later.[51] influenza may have been brought to the americas as early as 1493, when an epidemic disease resembling influenza killed most of the population of the antilles.[52][53] the first convincing record of an influenza pandemic was chronicled in 1510. it began in east asia before spreading to north africa and then europe.[48] following the pandemic, seasonal influenza occurred, with subsequent pandemics in 1557 and 1580.[51] the flu pandemic in 1557 was potentially the first time influenza was connected to miscarriage and death of pregnant women.[54] the 1580 flu pandemic originated in asia during summer, spread to africa, then europe, and finally america.[46] by the end of the 16th century, influenza was beginning to become understood as a specific, recognizable disease with epidemic and endemic forms.[51] in 1648, it was discovered that horses also experience influenza.[48] influenza data after 1700 is more accurate, so it is easier to identify flu pandemics after this point, each of which incrementally increased understanding of influenza.[55] the first flu pandemic of the 18th century started in 1729 in russia in spring, spreading worldwide over the course of three years with distinct waves, the later ones being more lethal. the second flu pandemic of the 18th century was in 1781\u20131782, starting in china in autumn.[46] from this pandemic, influenza became associated with sudden outbreaks of febrile illness.[55] the next flu pandemic was from 1830 to 1833, beginning in china in winter. this pandemic had a high attack rate, but the mortality rate was low.[24][46] a minor influenza pandemic occurred from 1847 to 1851 at the same time as the third cholera pandemic and was the first flu pandemic to occur with vital statistics being recorded, so influenza mortality was clearly recorded for the first time.[55] highly pathogenic avian influenza was recognized in 1878[55] and was soon linked to transmission to humans.[48] by the time of the 1889 pandemic, which may have been caused by an h2n2 strain,[56] the flu had become an easily recognizable disease.[48] the microbial agent responsible for influenza was incorrectly identified in 1892 by r. f. j. pfeiffer as the bacteria species haemophilus influenzae, which retains \"influenza\" in its name.[48][55] in succeeding years, the field of virology began to form as viruses were identified as the cause of many diseases. from 1901 to 1903, italian and austrian researchers were able to show that avian influenza, then called \"fowl plague\",[25] was caused by a microscopic agent smaller than bacteria by using filters with pores too small for bacteria to pass through. the fundamental differences between viruses and bacteria, however, were not yet fully understood.[55] the difference between the influenza mortality age distributions of the 1918 epidemic and normal epidemics. deaths per 100,000 persons in each age group, united states, for the interpandemic years 1911\u20131917 (dashed line) and the pandemic year 1918 (solid line).[57] from 1918 to 1920, the spanish flu pandemic became the most devastating influenza pandemic and one of the deadliest pandemics in history. the pandemic, probably caused by h1n1, likely began in the united states before spreading worldwide via soldiers during and after the first world war. the initial wave in the first half of 1918 was relatively minor and resembled past flu pandemics, but the second wave later that year had a much higher mortality rate,[46] accounting for most deaths. a third wave with lower mortality occurred in many places a few months after the second.[24] by the end of 1920, it is estimated that about a third[11] to half of all people in the world had been infected, with tens of millions of deaths, disproportionately young adults.[46] during the 1918 pandemic, the respiratory route of transmission was clearly identified[24] and influenza was shown to be caused by a \"filter passer\", not a bacterium, but there remained a lack of agreement about influenza's cause for another decade and research on influenza declined.[55] after the pandemic, h1n1 circulated in humans in seasonal form[1] up until the next pandemic.[55] in 1931, richard shope published three papers identifying a virus as the cause of swine influenza, a then newly recognized disease among pigs that was characterized during the second wave of the 1918 pandemic.[54][55] shope's research reinvigorated research on human influenza, and many advances in virology, serology, immunology, experimental animal models, vaccinology, and immunotherapy have since arisen from influenza research.[55] just two years after influenza viruses were discovered, in 1933, iav was identified as the agent responsible for human influenza.[54][58] subtypes of iav were discovered throughout the 1930s,[55] and ibv was discovered in 1940.[17] during the second world war, the us government worked on developing inactivated vaccines for influenza, resulting in the first influenza vaccine being licensed in 1945 in the united states.[1] icv was discovered two years later in 1947.[17] in 1955, avian influenza was confirmed to be caused by iav.[25] four influenza pandemics have occurred since wwii, each less severe than the 1918 pandemic. the first of these was the asian flu from 1957 to 1958, caused by an h2n2 strain[1][38] and beginning in china's yunnan province. the number of deaths probably exceeded one million, mostly among the very young and very old.[46] the 1957 pandemic was the first flu pandemic to occur in the presence of a global surveillance system and laboratories able to study the novel influenza virus.[24] after the pandemic, h2n2 was the iav subtype responsible for seasonal influenza.[1] the first antiviral drug against influenza, amantadine, was approved for use in 1966, with additional antiviral drugs being used since the 1990s.[4] in 1968, h3n2 was introduced into humans through a rearrangement between an avian h3n2 strain and an h2n2 strain that was circulating in humans. the novel h3n2 strain emerged in hong kong and spread worldwide, causing the hong kong flu pandemic, which resulted in 500,000\u20132,000,000 deaths. this was the first pandemic to spread significantly by air travel.[3][24] h2n2 and h3n2 co-circulated after the pandemic until 1971 when h2n2 waned in prevalence and was completely replaced by h3n2.[3] in 1977, h1n1 reemerged in humans, possibly after it was released from a freezer in a laboratory accident, and caused a pseudo-pandemic.[24][55] whether the 1977 \"pandemic\" deserves to be included in the natural history of flu pandemics is debatable.[46] this h1n1 strain was antigenically similar to the h1n1 strains that circulated prior to 1957. since 1977, both h1n1 and h3n2 have circulated in humans as part of seasonal influenza.[1] in 1980, the classification system used to subtype influenza viruses was introduced.[59] thermal imaging camera and screen, photographed in an airport terminal in greece during the 2009 flu pandemic. thermal imaging can detect elevated body temperature, one of the signs of swine flu. at some point, ibv diverged into two strains, named the b/victoria-like and b/yamagata-like lineages, both of which have been circulating in humans since 1983.[17] in 1996, hpai h5n1 was detected in guangdong, china[25] and a year later emerged in poultry in hong kong, gradually spreading worldwide from there. a small h5n1 outbreak in humans in hong kong occurred then,[31] and sporadic human cases have occurred since 1997, carrying a high case fatality rate.[15][40] the most recent flu pandemic was the 2009 swine flu pandemic, which originated in mexico and resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths.[24] it was caused by a novel h1n1 strain that was a reassortment of human, swine, and avian influenza viruses.[16][4] the 2009 pandemic had the effect of replacing prior h1n1 strains in circulation with the novel strain but not any other influenza viruses. consequently, h1n1, h3n2, and both ibv lineages have been in circulation in seasonal form since the 2009 pandemic.[1][24][25] in 2011, idv was discovered in pigs in oklahoma, usa, and cattle were later identified as the primary reservoir of idv.[10][17] in the same year,[40] avian h7n9 was detected in china and began to cause human infections in 2013, starting in shanghai and anhui and remaining mostly in china. hpai h7n9 emerged sometime in 2016 and has occasionally infected humans incidentally. other aivs have less commonly infected humans since the 1990s, including h5n6, h6n1, h7n2-4, h7n7, and h10n7-8,[15] and hpai h subtypes such as h5n1-3, h5n5-6, and h5n8 have begun to spread throughout much of the world since the 2010s. future flu pandemics, which may be caused by an influenza virus of avian origin,[25] are viewed as almost inevitable, and increased globalization has made it easier for novel viruses to spread,[24] so there are continual efforts to prepare for future pandemics[54] and improve the prevention and treatment of influenza.[1] etymology the word influenza comes from the italian word influenza, from medieval latin influentia, originally meaning 'visitation' or 'influence'. terms such as influenza di freddo, meaning 'influence of the cold', and influenza di stelle, meaning 'influence of the stars' are attested from the 14th century. the latter referred to the disease's cause, which at the time was ascribed by some to unfavorable astrological conditions. as early as 1504, influenza began to mean a 'visitation' or 'outbreak' of any disease affecting many people in a single place at once. during an outbreak of influenza in 1743 that started in italy and spread throughout europe, the word reached the english language and was anglicized in pronunciation. since the mid-1800s, influenza has also been used to refer to severe colds.[60][61][62] the shortened form of the word, \"(the) flu\", is first attested in 1839 as flue with the spelling flu confirmed in 1893.[63] other names that have been used for influenza include epidemic catarrh, la grippe from french, sweating sickness, and, especially when referring to the 1918 pandemic strain, spanish fever.[64] research professional examining a laboratory-grown reconstruction of the 1918 spanish flu virus in a biosafety level 3 environment influenza research is wide-ranging and includes efforts to understand how influenza viruses enter hosts, the relationship between influenza viruses and bacteria, how influenza symptoms progress, and what make some influenza viruses deadlier than others.[65] non-structural proteins encoded by influenza viruses are periodically discovered and their functions are continually under research.[21] past pandemics, and especially the 1918 pandemic, are the subject of much research to understand flu pandemics.[46] as part of pandemic preparedness, the global influenza surveillance and response system is a global network of laboratories that monitors influenza transmission and epidemiology.[66] additional areas of research include ways to improve the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of influenza. existing diagnostic methods have a variety of limitations coupled with their advantages. for example, nats have high sensitivity and specificity but are impractical in under-resourced regions due to their high cost, complexity, maintenance, and training required. low-cost, portable ridts can rapidly diagnose influenza but have highly variable sensitivity and are unable to subtype iav. as a result of these limitations and others, research into new diagnostic methods revolves around producing new methods that are cost-effective, less labor-intensive, and less complex than existing methods while also being able to differentiate influenza species and iav subtypes. one approach in development are lab-on-a-chips, which are diagnostic devices that make use of a variety of diagnostic tests, such as rt-pcr and serological assays, in microchip form. these chips have many potential advantages, including high reaction efficiency, low energy consumption, and low waste generation.[40] new antiviral drugs are also in development due to the elimination of adamantines as viable drugs and concerns over oseltamivir resistance. these include: na inhibitors that can be injected intravenously, such as intravenous formulations of zanamivir; favipiravir, which is a polymerase inhibitor used against several rna viruses; pimodivir, which prevents cap-binding required during viral transcription; and nitazoxanide, which inhibits ha maturation.[1][11] reducing excess inflammation in the respiratory tract is also subject to much research since this is one of the primary mechanisms of influenza pathology.[11][13] other forms of therapy in development include monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies that target viral proteins, convalescent plasma, different approaches to modify the host antiviral response,[33][67] and stem cell-based therapies to repair lung damage.[11] much research on laivs focuses on identifying genome sequences that can be deleted to create harmless influenza viruses in vaccines that still confer immunity.[21] the high variability and rapid evolution of influenza virus antigens, however, is a major obstacle in developing effective vaccines. furthermore, it is hard to predict which strains will be in circulation during the next flu season, manufacturing a sufficient quantity of flu vaccines for the next season is difficult,[2] laivs have limited efficacy, and repeated annual vaccination potentially has diminished efficacy.[1] for these reasons, \"broadly-reactive\" or \"universal\" flu vaccines are being researched that can provide protection against many or all influenza viruses. approaches to develop such a vaccine include ha stalk-based methods such as chimeras that have the same stalk but different heads, ha head-based methods such as computationally optimized broadly neutralizing antigens, anti-idiotypic antibodies, and vaccines to elicit immune responses to highly conserved viral proteins.[2][67] mrna vaccines to provide protection against influenza are also under research.[68] in recent years, controversy emerged over the ethical justifications for conducting certain 'gain-of-function' (gof) studies on influenza.[69] in animals birds aquatic birds such as ducks, geese, shorebirds, and gulls are the primary reservoir of iavs.[15][16] in birds, aivs may be either low pathogenic avian influenza (lpai) viruses that produce little to no symptoms or highly pathogenic avian influenza (hpai) viruses that cause severe illness. symptoms of hpai infection include lack of energy and appetite, decreased egg production, soft-shelled or misshapen eggs, swelling of the head, comb, wattles, and hocks, purple discoloration of wattles, combs, and legs, nasal discharge, coughing, sneezing, incoordination, and diarrhea. birds infected with an hpai virus may also die suddenly without any signs of infection.[39] the distinction between lpai and hpai can generally be made based on how lethal an aiv is to chickens. at the genetic level, an aiv can be usually be identified as an hpai virus if it has a multibasic cleavage site in the ha protein, which contains additional residues in the ha gene.[16][25] most aivs are lpai. notable hpai viruses include hpai h5n1 and hpai h7n9. hpai viruses have been a major disease burden in the 21st century, resulting in the death of large numbers of birds. in h7n9's case, some circulating strains were originally lpai but became hpai by acquiring the ha multibasic cleavage site. avian h9n2 is also of concern because although it is lpai, it is a common donor of genes to h5n1 and h7n9 during reassortment.[1] migratory birds can spread influenza across long distances. an example of this was when an h5n1 strain in 2005 infected birds at qinghai lake, china, which is a stopover and breeding site for many migratory birds, subsequently spreading the virus to more than 20 countries across asia, europe, and the middle east.[15][25] aivs can be transmitted from wild birds to domestic free-range ducks and in turn to poultry through contaminated water, aerosols, and fomites.[1] ducks therefore act as key intermediates between wild and domestic birds.[25] transmission to poultry typically occurs in backyard farming and live animal markets where multiple species interact with each other. from there, aivs can spread to poultry farms in the absence of adequate biosecurity. among poultry, hpai transmission occurs through aerosols and contaminated feces,[1] cages, feed, and dead animals.[15] back-transmission of hpai viruses from poultry to wild birds has occurred and is implicated in mass die-offs and intercontinental spread.[16] aivs have occasionally infected humans through aerosols, fomites, and contaminated water.[1] direction transmission from wild birds is rare.[25] instead, most transmission involves domestic poultry, mainly chickens, ducks, and geese but also a variety of other birds such as guinea fowl, partridge, pheasants, and quails.[16] the primary risk factor for infection with aivs is exposure to birds in farms and live poultry markets.[15] typically, infection with an aiv has an incubation period of 3\u20135 days but can be up to 9 days. h5n1 and h7n9 cause severe lower respiratory tract illness, whereas other aivs such as h9n2 cause a more mild upper respiratory tract illness, commonly with conjunctivitis.[1] limited transmission of avian h2, h5-7, h9, and h10 subtypes from one person to another through respiratory droplets, aerosols, and fomites has occurred,[1][2] but sustained human-to-human transmission of aivs has not occurred. before 2013, h5n1 was the most common aiv to infect humans. since then, h7n9 has been responsible for most human cases.[15] pigs chinese inspectors checking airline passengers for fevers, a common symptom of swine flu influenza in pigs is a respiratory disease similar to influenza in humans and is found worldwide. asymptomatic infections are common. symptoms typically appear 1\u20133 days after infection and include fever, lethargy, anorexia, weight loss, labored breathing, coughing, sneezing, and nasal discharge. in sows, pregnancy may be aborted. complications include secondary infections and potentially fatal bronchopneumonia. pigs become contagious within a day of infection and typically spread the virus for 7\u201310 days, which can spread rapidly within a herd. pigs usually recover from infection within 3\u20137 days after symptoms appear. prevention and control measures include inactivated vaccines and culling infected herds. the influenza viruses usually responsible for swine flu are iav subtypes h1n1, h1n2, and h3n2.[70] some iavs can be transmitted via aerosols from pigs to humans and vice versa.[1] furthermore, pigs, along with bats and quails,[17] are recognized as a mixing vessel of influenza viruses because they have both \u03b1-2,3 and \u03b1-2,6 sialic acid receptors in their respiratory tract. because of that, both avian and mammalian influenza viruses can infect pigs. if co-infection occurs, then reassortment is possible.[16] a notable example of this was the reassortment of a swine, avian, and human influenza virus in 2009, resulting in a novel h1n1 strain that caused the 2009 flu pandemic.[16][4] spillover events from humans to pigs, however, appear to be more common than from pigs to humans.[16] other animals influenza viruses have been found in many other animals, including cattle, horses, dogs, cats, and marine mammals. nearly all iavs are apparently descended from ancestral viruses in birds. the exception are bat influenza-like viruses, which have an uncertain origin. these bat viruses have ha and na subtypes h17, h18, n10, and n11. h17n10 and h18n11 are unable to reassort with other iavs, but they are still able to replicate in other mammals.[1] aivs sometimes crossover into mammals. for example, in late 2016 to early 2017, an avian h7n2 strain was found to be infecting cats in new york.[1] equine iavs include h7n7 and two lineages[1] of h3n8. h7n7, however, has not been detected in horses since the late 1970s,[19] so it may have become extinct in horses.[16] h3n8 in equines spreads via aerosols and causes respiratory illness.[1] equine h3n8 perferentially binds to \u03b1-2,3 sialic acids, so horses are usually considered dead-end hosts, but transmission to dogs and camels has occurred, raising concerns that horses may be mixing vessels for reassortment. in canines, the only iavs in circulation are equine-derived h3n8 and avian-derived h3n2. canine h3n8 has not been observed to reassort with other subtypes. h3n2 has a much broader host range and can reassort with h1n1 and h5n1. an isolated case of h6n1 likely from a chicken was found infecting a dog, so other aivs may emerge in canines.[16] other mammals to be infected by iavs include h7n7 and h4n5 in seals, h1n3 in whales, and h10n4 and h3n2 in minks.[19] various mutations have been identified that are associated with aivs adapting to mammals. since ha proteins vary in which sialic acids they bind to, mutations in the ha receptor binding site can allow aivs to infect mammals. other mutations include mutations affecting which sialic acids na proteins cleave and a mutation in the pb2 polymerase subunit that improves tolerance of lower temperatures in mammalian respiratory tracts and enhances rnp assembly by stabilizing np and pb2 binding.[16] ibv is mainly found in humans but has also been detected in pigs, dogs, horses, and seals.[17] likewise, icv primarily infects humans but has been observed in pigs, dogs, cattle, and dromedary camels.[10][17] idv causes an influenza-like illness in pigs but its impact in its natural reservoir, cattle, is relatively unknown. it may cause respiratory disease resembling human influenza on its own, or it may be part of a bovine respiratory disease (brd) complex with other pathogens during co-infection. brd is a concern for the cattle industry, so idv's possible involvement in brd has led to research on vaccines for cattle that can provide protection against idv.[17][18] two antigenic lineages are in circulation: d/swine/oklahoma/1334/2011 (d/ok) and d/bovine/oklahoma/660/2013 (d/660).[17] references ^ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z aa ab ac ad ae af

called sars-cov-2, causes coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). the virus that causes covid-19 spreads easily among people. data has shown that the covid-19 virus spreads mainly from person to person among those in close contact. the virus spreads by respiratory droplets released when someone with the virus coughs, sneezes, breathes, sings or talks. these droplets can be inhaled or land in the mouth, nose or eyes of a person nearby. sometimes the covid-19 virus can spread when a person is exposed to very small droplets or aerosols that stay in the air for several minutes or hours \u2014 called airborne transmission. the virus also can spread if you touch a surface with the virus on it and then touch your mouth, nose or eyes. but the risk is low. the covid-19 virus can spread from someone who is infected but has no symptoms. this is called asymptomatic transmission. the covid-19 virus also can spread from someone who is infected but hasn't developed symptoms yet. this is called presymptomatic transmission. it's possible to get covid-19 more than once. risk factorsrisk factors for covid-19 appear to include: close contact with someone who has covid-19, especially someone with symptoms. being coughed or sneezed on by an infected person. being near an infected person when in an indoor space with poor airflow. risk factors for serious covid-19 illness some people are at a higher risk of serious covid-19 illness than others. this includes people who are older, and the risk increases with age. people with existing medical conditions also may have a higher risk of serious illness. this includes people who have: sickle cell disease or thalassemia. serious heart diseases, such as heart failure, coronary artery disease or cardiomyopathy, and possibly high blood pressure. chronic kidney, liver or lung diseases. people with dementia or alzheimer's are also at higher risk, as are people with brain and nervous system conditions such as stroke. smoking increases the risk of serious covid-19 illness. and people with body mass index in the overweight category or obese category may have an increased risk as well. other medical conditions that may increase the risk of serious illness from covid-19 include: cancer. type 1 or type 2 diabetes. weakened immune system from solid organ transplants or bone marrow transplants, some medicines, or hiv. pregnancy. down syndrome. substance use disorders. this list is not complete. other medical conditions may increase your risk of serious illness from covid-19. related information covid-19: who's at higher risk of serious symptoms? - related informationcovid-19: who's at higher risk of serious symptoms? complicationsalthough most people with covid-19 have mild to moderate symptoms, the disease can cause severe medical complications and lead to death in some people. older adults or people with existing medical conditions are at greater risk of becoming seriously ill with covid-19. complications can include: pneumonia and trouble breathing. organ failure in several organs. heart problems. a severe lung condition that causes a low amount of oxygen to go through your bloodstream to your organs, called acute respiratory distress syndrome. blood clots. acute kidney injury. additional viral and bacterial infections. more informationlong-term effects of covid-19 preventionthe centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) recommends a covid-19 vaccine for everyone age 6 months and older. the covid-19 vaccine can lower the risk of death or serious illness caused by covid-19. it lowers your risk and lowers the risk that you may spread it to people around you. getting a covid-19 vaccine also is important because the flu and covid-19 may be spreading at the same time and cause similar symptoms. getting a covid-19 vaccine and a flu vaccine is the best way to protect against both. the covid-19 vaccines available in the united states are: 2023-2024 pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine. this vaccine is available for people age 6 months and older. among people with a typical immune system: children age 6 months up to age 4 years are up to date after three doses of a pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine. people age 5 and older are up to date after one pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine. for people who have not had a 2023-2024 covid-19 vaccination, the cdc recommends getting an additional shot of that updated vaccine. 2023-2024 moderna covid-19 vaccine. this vaccine is available for people age 6 months and older. among people with a typical immune system: children age 6 months up to age 4 are up to date if they've had two doses of a moderna covid-19 vaccine. people age 5 and older are up to date after one moderna covid-19 vaccine. for people who have not had a 2023-2024 covid-19 vaccination, the cdc recommends getting an additional shot of that updated vaccine. 2023-2024 novavax covid-19 vaccine. this vaccine is available for people age 12 years and older. among people with a typical immune system: people age 12 years and older are up to date if they've had two doses of a novavax covid-19 vaccine. for people who have not had a 2023-2024 covid-19 vaccination, the cdc recommends getting an additional shot of that updated vaccine. in general, people age 5 and older with typical immune systems can get any vaccine that is approved or authorized for their age. they usually don't need to get the same vaccine each time. some people should get all their vaccine doses from the same vaccine maker, including: children ages 6 months to 4 years. people age 5 years and older with weakened immune systems. people age 12 and older who have had one shot of the novavax vaccine should get the second novavax shot in the two-dose series. talk to your healthcare professional if you have any questions about the vaccines for you or your child. your healthcare team can help you if: the vaccine you or your child got earlier isn't available. you don't know which vaccine you or your child received. you or your child started a vaccine series but couldn't finish it due to side effects. people with weakened immune systems your health care team may suggest added doses of covid-19 vaccine if you have a moderately or severely weakened immune system. vaccination and other actions you can take many steps to lower your risk of infection from the covid-19 virus and lower the risk of spreading it to others. the world health organization (who) and cdc recommend following these precautions: get vaccinated. covid-19 vaccines reduce the risk of getting and spreading covid-19. avoid close contact with anyone who is sick or has symptoms. keep distance between yourself and others when you're in indoor public spaces. this is especially important if you have a higher risk of serious illness. keep in mind some people may have covid-19 and spread it to others, even if they don't have symptoms or don't know they have covid-19. avoid crowds and indoor places that have poor airflow, also called ventilation. wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. wear a face mask in indoor public spaces if you're in an area with a high number of people with covid-19 in the hospital. the cdc recommends wearing the most protective mask possible that you'll wear regularly, fits well and is comfortable. improve the airflow indoors. open windows. turn on fans to direct air out of windows. if you can't open windows, consider using air filters. and turn on exhaust fans in your bathroom and kitchen. you also might consider using a portable air cleaner. cover your mouth and nose. cover your mouth and nose with your elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze. throw away the used tissue. wash your hands right away. avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. avoid sharing dishes, glasses, towels, bedding and other household items if you're sick. clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces. for example, clean doorknobs, light switches, electronics and counters regularly. stay home from work, school and public areas, and stay home in isolation if you're sick, unless you're going to get medical care. avoid public transportation, taxis and ride-hailing services if you're sick. if you have a chronic medical condition and may have a higher risk of serious illness, check with your health care professional about other ways to protect yourself. related information covid-19 vaccines: get the facts - related informationcovid-19 vaccines: get the factscomparing the

(estimated) coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) is a contagious disease caused by the virus sars-cov-2. the first known case was identified in wuhan, china, in december 2019.[6] the disease quickly spread worldwide, resulting in the covid-19 pandemic. the symptoms of covid\u201119 are variable but often include fever,[7] cough, headache,[8] fatigue, breathing difficulties, loss of smell, and loss of taste.[9][10][11] symptoms may begin one to fourteen days after exposure to the virus. at least a third of people who are infected do not develop noticeable symptoms.[12][13] of those who develop symptoms noticeable enough to be classified as patients, most (81%) develop mild to moderate symptoms (up to mild pneumonia), while 14% develop severe symptoms (dyspnea, hypoxia, or more than 50% lung involvement on imaging), and 5% develop critical symptoms (respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan dysfunction).[14] older people are at a higher risk of developing severe symptoms. some people continue to experience a range of effects (long covid) for months or years after infection, and damage to organs has been observed.[15] multi-year studies are underway to further investigate the long-term effects of the disease.[16] covid\u201119 transmits when infectious particles are breathed in or come into contact with the eyes, nose, or mouth. the risk is highest when people are in close proximity, but small airborne particles containing the virus can remain suspended in the air and travel over longer distances, particularly indoors. transmission can also occur when people touch their eyes, nose or mouth after touching surfaces or objects that have been contaminated by the virus. people remain contagious for up to 20 days and can spread the virus even if they do not develop symptoms.[17] testing methods for covid-19 to detect the virus's nucleic acid include real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rt\u2011pcr),[18][19] transcription-mediated amplification,[18][19][20] and reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (rt\u2011lamp)[18][19] from a nasopharyngeal swab.[21] several covid-19 vaccines have been approved and distributed in various countries, which have initiated mass vaccination campaigns. other preventive measures include physical or social distancing, quarantining, ventilation of indoor spaces, use of face masks or coverings in public, covering coughs and sneezes, hand washing, and keeping unwashed hands away from the face. while work is underway to develop drugs that inhibit the virus, the primary treatment is symptomatic. management involves the treatment of symptoms through supportive care, isolation, and experimental measures. nomenclature main article: covid-19 naming during the initial outbreak in wuhan, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as \"coronavirus\" and \"wuhan coronavirus\",[22][23][24] with the disease sometimes called \"wuhan pneumonia\".[25][26] in the past, many diseases have been named after geographical locations, such as the spanish flu,[27] middle east respiratory syndrome, and zika virus.[28] in january 2020, the world health organization (who) recommended 2019-ncov[29] and 2019-ncov acute respiratory disease[30] as interim names for the virus and disease per 2015 guidance and international guidelines against using geographical locations or groups of people in disease and virus names to prevent social stigma.[31][32][33] the official names covid\u201119 and sars-cov-2 were issued by the who on 11 february 2020 with covid-19 being shorthand for \"coronavirus disease 2019\".[34][35] the who additionally uses \"the covid\u201119 virus\" and \"the virus responsible for covid\u201119\" in public communications.[34][36] symptoms and signs main article: symptoms of covid-19 symptoms of covid-19 the symptoms of covid-19 are variable depending on the type of variant contracted, ranging from mild symptoms to a potentially fatal illness.[37][38] common symptoms include coughing, fever, loss of smell (anosmia) and taste (ageusia), with less common ones including headaches, nasal congestion and runny nose, muscle pain, sore throat, diarrhea, eye irritation,[39] and toes swelling or turning purple,[40] and in moderate to severe cases, breathing difficulties.[41] people with the covid-19 infection may have different symptoms, and their symptoms may change over time. three common clusters of symptoms have been identified: one respiratory symptom cluster with cough, sputum, shortness of breath, and fever; a musculoskeletal symptom cluster with muscle and joint pain, headache, and fatigue; and a cluster of digestive symptoms with abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea.[41] in people without prior ear, nose, or throat disorders, loss of taste combined with loss of smell is associated with covid-19 and is reported in as many as 88% of symptomatic cases.[42][43][44] of people who show symptoms, 81% develop only mild to moderate symptoms (up to mild pneumonia), while 14% develop severe symptoms (dyspnea, hypoxia, or more than 50% lung involvement on imaging) that require hospitalization, and 5% of patients develop critical symptoms (respiratory failure, septic shock, or multiorgan dysfunction) requiring icu admission.[45][needs update] proportion of asymptomatic sars-cov-2 infection by age. about 44% of those infected with sars-cov-2 remained asymptomatic throughout the infection.[46] at least a third of the people who are infected with the virus do not develop noticeable symptoms at any point in time.[46][47][48] these asymptomatic carriers tend not to get tested and can still spread the disease.[48][49][50][51] other infected people will develop symptoms later (called \"pre-symptomatic\") or have very mild symptoms and can also spread the virus.[51] as is common with infections, there is a delay between the moment a person first becomes infected and the appearance of the first symptoms. the median delay for covid-19 is four to five days[52] possibly being infectious on 1-4 of those days.[53] most symptomatic people experience symptoms within two to seven days after exposure, and almost all will experience at least one symptom within 12 days.[52][54] most people recover from the acute phase of the disease. however, some people continue to experience a range of effects, such as fatigue, for months, even after recovery.[55] this is the result of a condition called long covid, which can be described as a range of persistent symptoms that continue for weeks or months at a time.[56] long-term damage to organs has also been observed after the onset of covid-19. multi-year studies are underway to further investigate the potential long-term effects of the disease.[57] the omicron variant became dominant in the u.s. in december 2021. symptoms with the omicron variant are less severe than they are with other variants.[58] complications mechanisms of sars-cov-2 cytokine storm and complications complications may include pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards), multi-organ failure, septic shock, and death.[59][60][61][62] cardiovascular complications may include heart failure, arrhythmias (including atrial fibrillation), heart inflammation, and thrombosis, particularly venous thromboembolism.[63][64][65][66][67][68] approximately 20\u201330% of people who present with covid\u201119 have elevated liver enzymes, reflecting liver injury.[69][70] neurologic manifestations include seizure, stroke, encephalitis, and guillain\u2013barr\u00e9 syndrome (which includes loss of motor functions).[71][72] following the infection, children may develop paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome, which has symptoms similar to kawasaki disease, which can be fatal.[73][74] in very rare cases, acute encephalopathy can occur, and it can be considered in those who have been diagnosed with covid\u201119 and have an altered mental status.[75] according to the us centers for disease control and prevention, pregnant women are at increased risk of becoming seriously ill from covid\u201119.[76] this is because pregnant women with covid\u201119 appear to be more likely to develop respiratory and obstetric complications that can lead to miscarriage, premature delivery and intrauterine growth restriction.[76] fungal infections such as aspergillosis, candidiasis, cryptococcosis and mucormycosis have been recorded in patients recovering from covid\u201119.[77][78] cause covid\u201119 is caused by infection with a strain of coronavirus known as 'severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2' (sars-cov-2).[79] transmission main article: transmission of covid-19 transmission of covid\u201119 covid-19 is mainly transmitted when people breathe in air contaminated by droplets/aerosols and small airborne particles containing the virus. infected people exhale those particles as they breathe, talk, cough, sneeze, or sing.[80][81][82][83] transmission is more likely the closer people are. however, infection can occur over longer distances, particularly indoors.[80][84] the transmission of the virus is carried out through virus-laden fluid particles, or droplets, which are created in the respiratory tract, and they are expelled by the mouth and the nose. there are three types of transmission: \u201cdroplet\u201d and \u201ccontact\u201d, which are associated with large droplets, and \u201cairborne\u201d, which is associated with small droplets.[85] if the droplets are above a certain critical size, they settle faster than they evaporate, and therefore they contaminate surfaces surrounding them.[85] droplets that are below a certain critical size, evaporate faster than they settle; due to that fact, they form nuclei that remain airborne for a long period of time over extensive distances.[85] infectivity can begin four to five days before the onset of symptoms.[86] infected people can spread the disease even if they are pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic.[87] most commonly, the peak viral load in upper respiratory tract samples occurs close to the time of symptom onset and declines after the first week after symptoms begin.[87] current evidence suggests a duration of viral shedding and the period of infectiousness of up to ten days following symptom onset for people with mild to moderate covid-19, and up to 20 days for persons with severe covid-19, including immunocompromised people.[88][87] infectious particles range in size from aerosols that remain suspended in the air for long periods of time to larger droplets that remain airborne briefly or fall to the ground.[89][90][91][92] additionally, covid-19 research has redefined the traditional understanding of how respiratory viruses are transmitted.[92][93] the largest droplets of respiratory fluid do not travel far, but can be inhaled or land on mucous membranes on the eyes, nose, or mouth to infect.[91] aerosols are highest in concentration when people are in close proximity, which leads to easier viral transmission when people are physically close,[91][92][93] but airborne transmission can occur at longer distances, mainly in locations that are poorly ventilated;[91] in those conditions small particles can remain suspended in the air for minutes to hours.[91][94] virology main article: sars-cov-2illustration of sarsr-cov virion severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. it was first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in wuhan.[95] all structural features of the novel sars-cov-2 virus particle occur in related coronaviruses in nature,[96] particularly in rhinolophus sinicus aka chinese horseshoe bats.[97] outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap which bursts its protective bubble.[98] hospital disinfectants, alcohols, heat, povidone-iodine, and ultraviolet-c (uv-c) irradiation are also effective disinfection methods for surfaces.[99] sars-cov-2 is closely related to the original sars-cov.[100] it is thought to have an animal (zoonotic) origin. genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus genetically clusters with the genus betacoronavirus, in subgenus sarbecovirus (lineage b) together with two bat-derived strains. it is 96% identical at the whole genome level to other bat coronavirus samples (batcov ratg13).[101][102][103] the structural proteins of sars-cov-2 include membrane glycoprotein (m), envelope protein (e), nucleocapsid protein (n), and the spike protein (s). the m protein of sars-cov-2 is about 98% similar to the m protein of bat sars-cov, maintains around 98% homology with pangolin sars-cov, and has 90% homology with the m protein of sars-cov; whereas, the similarity is only around 38% with the m protein of mers-cov.[104] sars-cov-2 variants main article: variants of sars-cov-2 the many thousands of sars-cov-2 variants are grouped into either clades or lineages.[105][106] the who, in collaboration with partners, expert networks, national authorities, institutions and researchers, have established nomenclature systems for naming and tracking sars-cov-2 genetic lineages by gisaid, nextstrain and pango. the expert group convened by the who recommended the labelling of variants using letters of the greek alphabet, for example, alpha, beta, delta, and gamma, giving the justification that they \"will be easier and more practical to discussed by non-scientific audiences.\"[107] nextstrain divides the variants into five clades (19a, 19b, 20a, 20b, and 20c), while gisaid divides them into seven (l, o, v, s, g, gh, and gr).[108] the pango tool groups variants into lineages, with many circulating lineages being classed under the b.1 lineage.[106][109] several notable variants of sars-cov-2 emerged throughout 2020.[110][111] cluster 5 emerged among minks and mink farmers in denmark.[112] after strict quarantines and a mink euthanasia campaign, the cluster was assessed to no longer be circulating among humans in denmark as of 1 february 2021.[113] as of december 2021[update], there are five dominant variants of sars-cov-2 spreading among global populations: the alpha variant (b.1.1.7, formerly called the uk variant), first found in london and kent, the beta variant (b.1.351, formerly called the south africa variant), the gamma variant (p.1, formerly called the brazil variant), the delta variant (b.1.617.2, formerly called the india variant),[114] and the omicron variant (b.1.1.529), which had spread to 57 countries as of 7 december.[115][116] pathophysiology covid\u201119 pathogenesis the sars-cov-2 virus can infect a wide range of cells and systems of the body. covid\u201119 is most known for affecting the upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) and the lower respiratory tract (windpipe and lungs).[117] the lungs are the organs most affected by covid\u201119 because the virus accesses host cells via the receptor for the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2), which is most abundant on the surface of type ii alveolar cells of the lungs.[118] the virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a \"spike\" to connect to the ace2 receptor and enter the host cell.[119] respiratory tract following viral entry, covid\u201119 infects the ciliated epithelium of the nasopharynx and upper airways.[120] autopsies of people who died of covid\u201119 have found diffuse alveolar damage, and lymphocyte-containing inflammatory infiltrates within the lung.[121] nervous system one common symptom, loss of smell, results from infection of the support cells of the olfactory epithelium, with subsequent damage to the olfactory neurons.[122] the involvement of both the central and peripheral nervous system in covid\u201119 has been reported in many medical publications.[123] it is clear that many people with covid-19 exhibit neurological or mental health issues. the virus is not detected in the central nervous system (cns) of the majority of covid-19 patients with neurological issues. however, sars-cov-2 has been detected at low levels in the brains of those who have died from covid\u201119, but these results need to be confirmed.[124] while virus has been detected in cerebrospinal fluid of autopsies, the exact mechanism by which it invades the cns remains unclear and may first involve invasion of peripheral nerves given the low levels of ace2 in the brain.[125][126][127] the virus may also enter the bloodstream from the lungs and cross the blood\u2013brain barrier to gain access to the cns, possibly within an infected white blood cell.[124] tropism and multiple organ injuries in sars-cov-2 infection research conducted when alpha was the dominant variant has suggested covid-19 may cause brain damage.[128] later research showed that all variants studied (including omicron) killed brain cells, but the exact cells killed varied by variant.[129] it is unknown if such damage is temporary or permanent.[130][131] observed individuals infected with covid-19 (most with mild cases) experienced an additional 0.2% to 2% of brain tissue lost in regions of the brain connected to the sense of smell compared with uninfected individuals, and the overall effect on the brain was equivalent on average to at least one extra year of normal ageing; infected individuals also scored lower on several cognitive tests. all effects were more pronounced among older ages.[132] gastrointestinal tract the virus also affects gastrointestinal organs as ace2 is abundantly expressed in the glandular cells of gastric, duodenal and rectal epithelium[133] as well as endothelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine.[134] cardiovascular system the virus can cause acute myocardial injury and chronic damage to the cardiovascular system.[135][136] an acute cardiac injury was found in 12% of infected people admitted to the hospital in wuhan, china,[137] and is more frequent in severe disease.[138] rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high, owing to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, but acute myocardial injuries may also be related to ace2 receptors in the heart.[136] ace2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in heart function.[136][139] a high incidence of thrombosis and venous thromboembolism occurs in people transferred to intensive care units with covid\u201119 infections, and may be related to poor prognosis.[140] blood vessel dysfunction and clot formation (as suggested by high d-dimer levels caused by blood clots) may have a significant role in mortality, incidents of clots leading to pulmonary embolisms, and ischaemic events (strokes) within the brain found as complications leading to death in people infected with covid\u201119.[141] infection may initiate a chain of vasoconstrictive responses within the body, including pulmonary vasoconstriction \u2013 a possible mechanism in which oxygenation decreases during pneumonia.[141] furthermore, damage of arterioles and capillaries was found in brain tissue samples of people who died from covid\u201119.[142][143] covid\u201119 may also cause substantial structural changes to blood cells, sometimes persisting for months after hospital discharge.[144] a low level of blood lymphocytes may result from the virus acting through ace2-related entry into lymphocytes.[145] kidneys another common cause of death is complications related to the kidneys.[141] early reports show that up to 30% of hospitalised patients both in china and in new york have experienced some injury to their kidneys, including some persons with no previous kidney problems.[146] immunopathology key components of the adaptive immune response to sars-cov-2 although sars-cov-2 has a tropism for ace2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, people with severe covid\u201119 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation. clinical laboratory findings of elevated il\u20112, il\u20117, il\u20116, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (gm\u2011csf), interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (ip\u201110), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (mcp1), macrophage inflammatory protein 1\u2011alpha (mip\u20111\u2011alpha), and tumour necrosis factor (tnf\u2011\u03b1) indicative of cytokine release syndrome (crs) suggest an underlying immunopathology.[137] interferon alpha plays a complex, janus-faced role in the pathogenesis of covid-19. although it promotes the elimination of virus-infected cells, it also upregulates the expression of ace-2, thereby facilitating the sars-cov2 virus to enter cells and to replicate.[147][148] a competition of negative feedback loops (via protective effects of interferon alpha) and positive feedback loops (via upregulation of ace-2) is assumed to determine the fate of patients suffering from covid-19.[149] additionally, people with covid\u201119 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) have classical serum biomarkers of crs, including elevated c-reactive protein (crp), lactate dehydrogenase (ldh), d-dimer, and ferritin.[150] systemic inflammation results in vasodilation, allowing inflammatory lymphocytic and monocytic infiltration of the lung and the heart. in particular, pathogenic gm-csf-secreting t cells were shown to correlate with the recruitment of inflammatory il-6-secreting monocytes and severe lung pathology in people with covid\u201119.[151] lymphocytic infiltrates have also been reported at autopsy.[121] viral and host factors virus proteins the association between sars-cov-2 and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (raas) multiple viral and host factors affect the pathogenesis of the virus. the s-protein, otherwise known as the spike protein, is the viral component that attaches to the host receptor via the ace2 receptors. it includes two subunits: s1 and s2. s1 determines the virus-host range and cellular tropism via the receptor-binding domain. s2 mediates the membrane fusion of the virus to its potential cell host via the h1 and hr2, which are heptad repeat regions. studies have shown that s1 domain induced igg and iga antibody levels at a much higher capacity. it is the focus spike proteins expression that are involved in many effective covid\u201119 vaccines.[152] the m protein is the viral protein responsible for the transmembrane transport of nutrients. it is the cause of the bud release and the formation of the viral envelope.[153] the n and e protein are accessory proteins that interfere with the host's immune response.[153] host factors human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hace2) is the host factor that sars-cov-2 virus targets causing covid\u201119. theoretically, the usage of angiotensin receptor blockers (arb) and ace inhibitors upregulating ace2 expression might increase morbidity with covid\u201119, though animal data suggest some potential protective effect of arb; however no clinical studies have proven susceptibility or outcomes. until further data is available, guidelines and recommendations for hypertensive patients remain.[154] the effect of the virus on ace2 cell surfaces leads to leukocytic infiltration, increased blood vessel permeability, alveolar wall permeability, as well as decreased secretion of lung surfactants. these effects cause the majority of the respiratory symptoms. however, the aggravation of local inflammation causes a cytokine storm eventually leading to a systemic inflammatory response syndrome.[155] among healthy adults not exposed to sars-cov-2, about 35% have cd4+ t cells that recognise the sars-cov-2 s protein (particularly the s2 subunit) and about 50% react to other proteins of the virus, suggesting cross-reactivity from previous common colds caused by other coronaviruses.[156] it is unknown whether different persons use similar antibody genes in response to covid\u201119.[157] host cytokine response mild versus severe immune response during virus infection the severity of the inflammation can be attributed to the severity of what is known as the cytokine storm.[158] levels of interleukin 1b, interferon-gamma, interferon-inducible protein 10, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 were all associated with covid\u201119 disease severity. treatment has been proposed to combat the cytokine storm as it remains to be one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in covid\u201119 disease.[159] a cytokine storm is due to an acute hyperinflammatory response that is responsible for clinical illness in an array of diseases but in covid\u201119, it is related to worse prognosis and increased fatality. the storm causes acute respiratory distress syndrome, blood clotting events such as strokes, myocardial infarction, encephalitis, acute kidney injury, and vasculitis. the production of il-1, il-2, il-6, tnf-alpha, and interferon-gamma, all crucial components of normal immune responses, inadvertently become the causes of a cytokine storm. the cells of the central nervous system, the microglia, neurons, and astrocytes, are also involved in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines affecting the nervous system, and effects of cytokine storms toward the cns are not uncommon.[160] pregnancy response there are many unknowns for pregnant women during the covid-19 pandemic. given that they are prone to have complications and severe disease infection with other types of coronaviruses, they have been identified as a vulnerable group and advised to take supplementary preventive measures.[161] physiological responses to pregnancy can include: immunological: the immunological response to covid-19, like other viruses, depends on a working immune system. it adapts during pregnancy to allow the development of the foetus whose genetic load is only partially shared with their mother, leading to a different immunological reaction to infections during the course of pregnancy.[161] respiratory: many factors can make pregnant women more vulnerable to hard respiratory infections. one of them is the total reduction of the lungs' capacity and inability to clear secretions.[161] coagulation: during pregnancy, there are higher levels of circulating coagulation factors, and the pathogenesis of sars-cov-2 infection can be implicated. the thromboembolic events with associated mortality are a risk for pregnant women.[161] however, from the evidence base, it is difficult to conclude whether pregnant women are at increased risk of grave consequences of this virus.[161] in addition to the above, other clinical studies have proved that sars-cov-2 can affect the period of pregnancy in different ways. on the one hand, there is little evidence of its impact up to 12 weeks gestation. on the other hand, covid-19 infection may cause increased rates of unfavourable outcomes in the course of the pregnancy. some examples of these could be foetal growth restriction, preterm birth, and perinatal mortality, which refers to the foetal death past 22 or 28 completed weeks of pregnancy as well as the death among live-born children up to seven completed days of life.[161] for preterm birth, a 2023 review indicates that there appears to be a correlation with covid-19.[162] unvaccinated women in later stages of pregnancy with covid-19 are more likely than other patients to need very intensive care. babies born to mothers with covid-19 are more likely to have breathing problems. pregnant women are strongly encouraged to get vaccinated.[163] diagnosis further information: covid-19 testing covid\u201119 can provisionally be diagnosed on the basis of symptoms and confirmed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) or other nucleic acid testing of infected secretions.[21][164] along with laboratory testing, chest ct scans may be helpful to diagnose covid\u201119 in individuals with a high clinical suspicion of infection.[165] detection of a past infection is possible with serological tests, which detect antibodies produced by the body in response to the infection.[21] viral testing main article: covid-19 testing demonstration of a nasopharyngeal swab for covid\u201119 testing the standard methods of testing for presence of sars-cov-2 are nucleic acid tests,[21][166] which detects the presence of viral rna fragments.[167] as these tests detect rna but not infectious virus, its \"ability to determine duration of infectivity of patients is limited.\"[168] the test is typically done on respiratory samples obtained by a nasopharyngeal swab; however, a nasal swab or sputum sample may also be used.[169][170] results are generally available within hours.[21] the who has published several testing protocols for the disease.[171] several laboratories and companies have developed serological tests, which detect antibodies produced by the body in response to infection. several have been evaluated by public health england and approved for use in the uk.[172] the university of oxford's cebm has pointed to mounting evidence[173][174] that \"a good proportion of 'new' mild cases and people re-testing positives after quarantine or discharge from hospital are not infectious, but are simply clearing harmless virus particles which their immune system has efficiently dealt with\" and have called for \"an international effort to standardize and periodically calibrate testing\"[175] in september 2020, the uk government issued \"guidance for procedures to be implemented in laboratories to provide assurance of positive sars-cov-2 rna results during periods of low prevalence, when there is a reduction in the predictive value of positive test results\".[176] imaging a ct scan of a person with covid-19 shows lesions (bright regions) in the lungs ct scan of rapid progression stage of covid-19 chest x-ray showing covid\u201119 pneumonia chest ct scans may be helpful to diagnose covid\u201119 in individuals with a high clinical suspicion of infection but are not recommended for routine screening.[165][177] bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacities with a peripheral, asymmetric, and posterior distribution are common in early infection.[165][178] subpleural dominance, crazy paving (lobular septal thickening with variable alveolar filling), and consolidation may appear as the disease progresses.[165][179] characteristic imaging features on chest radiographs and computed tomography (ct) of people who are symptomatic include asymmetric peripheral ground-glass opacities without pleural effusions.[180] many groups have created covid\u201119 datasets that include imagery such as the italian radiological society which has compiled an international online database of imaging findings for confirmed cases.[181] due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, imaging without confirmation by rrt-pcr is of limited specificity in identifying covid\u201119.[180] a large study in china compared chest ct results to pcr and demonstrated that though imaging is less specific for the infection, it is faster and more sensitive.[164] coding in late 2019, the who assigned emergency icd-10 disease codes u07.1 for deaths from lab-confirmed sars-cov-2 infection and u07.2 for deaths from clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed covid\u201119 without lab-confirmed sars-cov-2 infection.[182] pathology the main pathological findings at autopsy are: macroscopy: pericarditis, lung consolidation and pulmonary oedema[121] lung findings: minor serous exudation, minor fibrin exudation[121] pulmonary oedema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and multinucleated giant cell formation[121] diffuse alveolar damage (dad) with diffuse alveolar exudates. dad is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) and severe hypoxaemia.[121] organisation of exudates in alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis[121] plasmocytosis in bal[183] blood and vessels: disseminated intravascular coagulation (dic);[184] leukoerythroblastic reaction,[185] endotheliitis,[186] hemophagocytosis[186] heart: cardiac muscle cell necrosis[186] liver: microvesicular steatosis[121] nose: shedding of olfactory epithelium[122] brain: infarction[186] kidneys: acute tubular damage.[186] spleen: white pulp depletion.[186] prevention further information: covid-19 vaccine, workplace hazard controls for covid-19, pandemic prevention, non-pharmaceutical intervention, preparations prior to covid-19, covid-19 surveillance, and covid-19 apps without pandemic containment measures \u2013 such as social distancing, vaccination, and face masks \u2013 pathogens can spread exponentially.[187] this graphic shows how early adoption of containment measures tends to protect wider swaths of the population. preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include getting vaccinated, staying at home, wearing a mask in public, avoiding crowded places, keeping distance from others, ventilating indoor spaces, managing potential exposure durations,[188] washing hands with soap and water often and for at least twenty seconds, practising good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.[189][190] those diagnosed with covid\u201119 or who believe they may be infected are advised by the cdc to stay home except to get medical care, call ahead before visiting a healthcare provider, wear a face mask before entering the healthcare provider's office and when in any room or vehicle with another person, cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue, regularly wash hands with soap and water and avoid sharing personal household items.[191][192] the first covid\u201119 vaccine was granted regulatory approval on 2 december 2020 by the uk medicines regulator mhra.[193] it was evaluated for emergency use authorisation (eua) status by the us fda, and in several other countries.[194] initially, the us national institutes of health guidelines do not recommend any medication for prevention of covid\u201119, before or after exposure to the sars-cov-2 virus, outside the setting of a clinical trial.[195][70] without a vaccine, other prophylactic measures, or effective treatments, a key part of managing covid\u201119 is trying to decrease and delay the epidemic peak, known as \"flattening the curve\".[196] this is done by slowing the infection rate to decrease the risk of health services being overwhelmed, allowing for better treatment of active cases, and delaying additional cases until effective treatments or a vaccine become available.[196][197] vaccine main article: covid-19 vaccine different vaccine candidate types in development for sars-cov-2 death rates for unvaccinated americans substantially exceeded those who were vaccinated, with bivalent boosters further reducing the death rate.[198] prior to the covid\u201119 pandemic, an established body of knowledge existed about the structure and function of coronaviruses causing diseases like severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) and middle east respiratory syndrome (mers). this knowledge accelerated the development of various vaccine platforms in early 2020.[199] the initial focus of sars-cov-2 vaccines was on preventing symptomatic, often severe, illness.[200] in 2020, the first covid\u201119 vaccines were developed and made available to the public through emergency authorizations[201] and conditional approvals.[202][203] initially, most covid\u201119 vaccines were two-dose vaccines, with the sole exception being the single-dose janssen covid\u201119 vaccine.[201] however, immunity from the vaccines has been found to wane over time, requiring people to get booster doses of the vaccine to maintain protection against covid\u201119.[201] the covid\u201119 vaccines are widely credited for their role in reducing the spread of covid\u201119 and reducing the severity and death caused by covid\u201119.[201][204] according to a june 2022 study, covid\u201119 vaccines prevented an additional 14.4 to 19.8 million deaths in 185 countries and territories from 8 december 2020 to 8 december 2021.[205][206] many countries implemented phased distribution plans that prioritized those at highest risk of complications, such as the elderly, and those at high risk of exposure and transmission, such as healthcare workers.[207][208] common side effects of covid\u201119 vaccines include soreness, redness, rash, inflammation at the injection site, fatigue, headache, myalgia (muscle pain), and arthralgia (joint pain), which resolve without medical treatment within a few days.[209][210] covid\u201119 vaccination is safe for people who are pregnant or are breastfeeding.[211] as of 9 november 2023[update], 13.53 billion doses of covid\u201119 vaccines have been administered worldwide, based on official reports from national public health agencies.[212] by december 2020, more than 10 billion vaccine doses had been preordered by countries,[213] with about half of the doses purchased by high-income countries comprising 14% of the world's population.[214] despite the extremely rapid development of effective mrna and viral vector vaccines, worldwide vaccine equity has not been achieved. the development and use of whole inactivated virus (wiv) and protein-based vaccines have also been recommended, especially for use in developing countries.[215][216] the 2023 nobel prize in physiology or medicine was awarded to katalin karik\u00f3 and drew weissman for the development of effective mrna vaccines against covid-19.[217][218][219] face masks and respiratory hygiene main article: face masks during the covid-19 pandemic masks with an exhalation valve. the valves are a weak point that can transmit the viruses outwards. us ambassador to indonesia sung kim accompanied by local officials at the presidential palace wearing face masks amid the covid-19 pandemic in community and healthcare settings, the use of face masks is intended as source control to limit transmission of the virus and for personal protection to prevent infection.[220] properly worn masks both limit the respiratory droplets and aerosols spread by infected individuals and help protect healthy individuals from infection.[221][222] reviews of various kinds of scientific studies have concluded that masking is effective in protecting the individual against covid-19.[221][223][224] various case-control and population-based studies have also shown that increased levels of masking in a community reduces the spread of sars-cov-2,[223][224] though there is a paucity of evidence from randomized controlled trials (rcts).[225][226] masks vary in how well they work, with n95 and surgical masks outperforming cloth masks,[227] but even cloth masks, with their variability in fabric type and mask fit, provide wearers with substantial protection from particles carrying covid-19.[228] among readily available fabrics, double-layered cotton, hybrid masks, and cotton flannel perform best,[228] and filtration effectiveness generally improves with thread count.[227] healthcare workers, given their exposure, are recommended against using cloth masks.[228] indoor ventilation and avoiding crowded indoor spaces the cdc states that avoiding crowded indoor spaces reduces the risk of covid-19 infection.[229] when indoors, increasing the rate of air change, decreasing recirculation of air and increasing the use of outdoor air can reduce transmission.[229][230] the who recommends ventilation and air filtration in public spaces to help clear out infectious aerosols.[231][232][233] exhaled respiratory particles can build-up within enclosed spaces with inadequate ventilation. the risk of covid\u201119 infection increases especially in spaces where people engage in physical exertion or raise their voice (e.g., exercising, shouting, singing) as this increases exhalation of respiratory droplets. prolonged exposure to these conditions, typically more than 15 minutes, leads to higher risk of infection.[229] displacement ventilation with large natural inlets can move stale air directly to the exhaust in laminar flow while significantly reducing the concentration of droplets and particles. passive ventilation reduces energy consumption and maintenance costs but may lack controllability and heat recovery. displacement ventilation can also be achieved mechanically with higher energy and maintenance costs. the use of large ducts and openings helps to prevent mixing in closed environments. recirculation and mixing should be avoided because recirculation prevents dilution of harmful particles and redistributes possibly contaminated air, and mixing increases the concentration and range of infectious particles and keeps larger particles in the air.[234] hand-washing and hygiene main article: hand washing students in rwanda hand washing and wearing face masks during the covid\u201119 pandemic in the country. thorough hand hygiene after any cough or sneeze is required.[235] the who also recommends that individuals wash hands often with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after blowing one's nose.[236] when soap and water are not available, the cdc recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitiser with at least 60% alcohol.[237] for areas where commercial hand sanitisers are not readily available, the who provides two formulations for local production. in these formulations, the antimicrobial activity arises from ethanol or isopropanol. hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in the alcohol; it is \"not an active substance for hand antisepsis.\" glycerol is added as a humectant.[238] social distancing main article: social distancing measures related to the covid-19 pandemic social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes infection control actions intended to slow the spread of the disease by minimising close contact between individuals. methods include quarantines; travel restrictions; and the closing of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shopping centres. individuals may apply social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using no-contact greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others.[239] in 2020, outbreaks occurred in prisons due to crowding and an inability to enforce adequate social distancing.[240][241] in the united states, the prisoner population is ageing and many of them are at high risk for poor outcomes from covid\u201119 due to high rates of coexisting heart and lung disease, and poor access to high-quality healthcare.[240] surface cleaning after being expelled from the body, coronaviruses can survive on surfaces for hours to days. if a person touches the dirty surface, they may deposit the virus at the eyes, nose, or mouth where it can enter the body and cause infection.[242] evidence indicates that contact with infected surfaces is not the main driver of covid\u201119,[243][244][245] leading to recommendations for optimised disinfection procedures to avoid issues such as the increase of antimicrobial resistance through the use of inappropriate cleaning products and processes.[246][247] deep cleaning and other surface sanitation has been criticised as hygiene theatre, giving a false sense of security against something primarily spread through the air.[248][249] the amount of time that the virus can survive depends significantly on the type of surface, the temperature, and the humidity.[250] coronaviruses die very quickly when exposed to the uv light in sunlight.[250] like other enveloped viruses, sars-cov-2 survives longest when the temperature is at room temperature or lower, and when the relative humidity is low (<50%).[250] on many surfaces, including glass, some types of plastic, stainless steel, and skin, the virus can remain infective for several days indoors at room temperature, or even about a week under ideal conditions.[250][251] on some surfaces, including cotton fabric and copper, the virus usually dies after a few hours.[250] the virus dies faster on porous surfaces than on non-porous surfaces due to capillary action within pores and faster aerosol droplet evaporation.[252][245][250] however, of the many surfaces tested, two with the longest survival times are n95 respirator masks and surgical masks, both of which are considered porous surfaces.[250] the cdc says that in most situations, cleaning surfaces with soap or detergent, not disinfecting, is enough to reduce risk of transmission.[253][254] the cdc recommends that if a covid\u201119 case is suspected or confirmed at a facility such as an office or day care, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, shared electronic equipment like tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and atms used by the ill persons should be disinfected.[255] surfaces may be decontaminated with 62\u201371 per cent ethanol, 50\u2013100 per cent isopropanol, 0.1 per cent sodium hypochlorite, 0.5 per cent hydrogen peroxide, 0.2\u20137.5 per cent povidone-iodine, or 50\u2013200 ppm hypochlorous acid. other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective. ultraviolet germicidal irradiation may also be used,[231] although popular devices require 5\u201310 min exposure and may deteriorate some materials over time.[256] a datasheet comprising the authorised substances to disinfection in the food industry (including suspension or surface tested, kind of surface, use dilution, disinfectant and inoculum volumes) can be seen in the supplementary material of.[246] self-isolation self-isolation at home has been recommended for those diagnosed with covid\u201119 and those who suspect they have been infected. health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation.[257] many governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for entire populations. the strongest self-quarantine instructions have been issued to those in high-risk groups.[258] those who may have been exposed to someone with covid\u201119 and those who have recently travelled to a country or region with the widespread transmission have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of last possible exposure.[259] international travel-related control measures a 2021 cochrane rapid review found that based upon low-certainty evidence, international travel-related control measures such as restricting cross-border travel may help to contain the spread of covid\u201119.[260] additionally, symptom/exposure-based screening measures at borders may miss many positive cases.[260] while test-based border screening measures may be more effective, it could also miss many positive cases if only conducted upon arrival without follow-up. the review concluded that a minimum 10-day quarantine may be beneficial in preventing the spread of covid\u201119 and may be more effective if combined with an additional control measure like border screening.[260] treatment main article: treatment and management of covid-19 an overview of covid-19 therapeutics and drugs although several medications have been approved in different countries as of april 2022, not all countries have these medications. patients with mild to moderate symptoms who are in the risk groups can take nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (marketed as paxlovid) or remdesivir, either of which reduces the risk of serious illness or hospitalization.[261] in the us, the biden administration covid-19 action plan includes the test to treat initiative, where people can go to a pharmacy, take a covid test, and immediately receive free paxlovid if they test positive.[262] highly effective vaccines have reduced mortality related to sars-cov-2; however, for those awaiting vaccination, as well as for the estimated millions of immunocompromised persons who are unlikely to respond robustly to vaccination, treatment remains important.[263] the cornerstone of management of covid-19 has been supportive care, which includes treatment to relieve symptoms, fluid therapy, oxygen support and prone positioning as needed, and medications or devices to support other affected vital organs.[264][265][266] most cases of covid-19 are mild. in these, supportive care includes medication such as paracetamol or nsaids to relieve symptoms (fever, body aches, cough), proper intake of fluids, rest, and nasal breathing.[267][268][269][270] good personal hygiene and a healthy diet are also recommended.[271] as of april 2020 the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) recommended that those who suspect they are carrying the virus isolate themselves at home and wear a face mask.[272] as of november 2020 use of the glucocorticoid dexamethasone had been strongly recommended in those severe cases treated in hospital with low oxygen levels, to reduce the risk of death.[273][274][275] noninvasive ventilation and, ultimately, admission to an intensive care unit for mechanical ventilation may be required to support breathing.[276] extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ecmo) has been used to address respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under consideration.[277][278] some of the cases of severe disease course are caused by systemic hyper-inflammation, the so-called cytokine storm.[279] prognosis and risk factors see also: covid-19 pandemic death rates by country the severity of covid\u201119 varies. the disease may take a mild course with few or no symptoms, resembling other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold. in 3\u20134% of cases (7.4% for those over age 65) symptoms are severe enough to cause hospitalisation.[280] mild cases typically recover within two weeks, while those with severe or critical diseases may take three to six weeks to recover. among those who have died, the time from symptom onset to death has ranged from two to eight weeks.[101] the italian istituto superiore di sanit\u00e0 reported that the median time between the onset of symptoms and death was twelve days, with seven being hospitalised. however, people transferred to an icu had a median time of ten days between hospitalisation and death.[281] abnormal sodium levels during hospitalisation with covid-19 are associated with poor prognoses: high sodium with a greater risk of death, and low sodium with an increased chance of needing ventilator support.[282][283] prolonged prothrombin time and elevated c-reactive protein levels on admission to the hospital are associated with severe course of covid\u201119 and with a transfer to icu.[284][285] some early studies suggest 10% to 20% of people with covid\u201119 will experience symptoms lasting longer than a month.[286][287] a majority of those who were admitted to hospital with severe disease report long-term problems including fatigue and shortness of breath.[288] on 30 october 2020, who chief tedros adhanom warned that \"to a significant number of people, the covid virus poses a range of serious long-term effects.\" he has described the vast spectrum of covid\u201119 symptoms that fluctuate over time as \"really concerning\". they range from fatigue, a cough and shortness of breath, to inflammation and injury of major organs \u2013 including the lungs and heart, and also neurological and psychologic effects. symptoms often overlap and can affect any system in the body. infected people have reported cyclical bouts of fatigue, headaches, months of complete exhaustion, mood swings, and other symptoms. tedros therefore concluded that a strategy of achieving herd immunity by infection, rather than vaccination, is \"morally unconscionable and unfeasible\".[289] in terms of hospital readmissions about 9% of 106,000 individuals had to return for hospital treatment within two months of discharge. the average to readmit was eight days since first hospital visit. there are several risk factors that have been identified as being a cause of multiple admissions to a hospital facility. among these are advanced age (above 65 years of age) and presence of a chronic condition such as diabetes, copd, heart failure or chronic kidney disease.[290][291] according to scientific reviews smokers are more likely to require intensive care or die compared to non-smokers.[292][293] acting on the same ace2 pulmonary receptors affected by smoking, air pollution has been correlated with the disease.[293] short term[294] and chronic[295] exposure to air pollution seems to enhance morbidity and mortality from covid\u201119.[296][297][298] pre-existing heart and lung diseases[299] and also obesity, especially in conjunction with fatty liver disease, contributes to an increased health risk of covid\u201119.[293][300][301][302] it is also assumed that those that are immunocompromised are at higher risk of getting severely sick from sars-cov-2.[303] one research study that looked into the covid\u201119 infections in hospitalised kidney transplant recipients found a mortality rate of 11%.[304] men with untreated hypogonadism were 2.4 times more likely than men with eugonadism to be hospitalised if they contracted covid-19; hypogonad men treated with testosterone were less likely to be hospitalised for covid-19 than men who were not treated for hypogonadism.[305] genetic risk factors genetics plays an important role in the ability to fight off covid.[306] for instance, those that do not produce detectable type i interferons or produce auto-antibodies against these may get much sicker from covid\u201119.[307][308] genetic screening is able to detect interferon effector genes.[309] some genetic variants are risk factors in specific populations. for instance, an allele of the dock2 gene (dedicator of cytokinesis 2 gene) is a common risk factor in asian populations but much less common in europe. the mutation leads to lower expression of dock2 especially in younger patients with severe covid.[310] in fact, many other genes and genetic variants have been found that determine the outcome of sars-cov-2 infections.[311] children see also: impact of the covid-19 pandemic on children while very young children have experienced lower rates of infection, older children have a rate of infection that is similar to the population as a whole.[312][313] children are likely to have milder symptoms and are at lower risk of severe disease than adults.[314] the cdc reports that in the us roughly a third of hospitalised children were admitted to the icu,[315] while a european multinational study of hospitalised children from june 2020, found that about 8% of children admitted to a hospital needed intensive care.[316] four of the 582 children (0.7%) in the european study died, but the actual mortality rate may be \"substantially lower\" since milder cases that did not seek medical help were not included in the study.[317][318] long-term effects further information: long covid around 10% to 30% of non-hospitalised people with covid-19 go on to develop long covid. for those that do need hospitalisation, the incidence of long-term effects is over 50%.[15] long covid is an often severe multisystem disease with a large set of symptoms. there are likely various, possibly coinciding, causes.[15] organ damage from the acute infection can explain a part of the symptoms, but long covid is also observed in people where organ damage seems to be absent.[319] by a variety of mechanisms, the lungs are the organs most affected in covid\u201119.[320] in people requiring hospital admission, up to 98% of ct scans performed show lung abnormalities after 28 days of illness even if they had clinically improved.[321] people with advanced age, severe disease, prolonged icu stays, or who smoke are more likely to have long-lasting effects, including pulmonary fibrosis.[322] overall, approximately one-third of those investigated after four weeks will have findings of pulmonary fibrosis or reduced lung function as measured by dlco, even in asymptomatic people, but with the suggestion of continuing improvement with the passing of more time.[320] after severe disease, lung function can take anywhere from three months to a year or more to return to previous levels.[323] the risks of cognitive deficit, dementia, psychotic disorders, and epilepsy or seizures persists at an increased level two years after infection.[324] immunity see also: covid-19 vaccine human antibody response to sars-cov-2 infection the immune response by humans to sars-cov-2 virus occurs as a combination of the cell-mediated immunity and antibody production,[325] just as with most other infections.[326] b cells interact with t cells and begin dividing before selection into the plasma cell, partly on the basis of their affinity for antigen.[327] since sars-cov-2 has been in the human population only since december 2019, it remains unknown if the immunity is long-lasting in people who recover from the disease.[328] the presence of neutralising antibodies in blood strongly correlates with protection from infection, but the level of neutralising antibody declines with time. those with asymptomatic or mild disease had undetectable levels of neutralising antibody two months after infection. in another study, the level of neutralising antibodies fell four-fold one to four months after the onset of symptoms. however, the lack of antibodies in the blood does not mean antibodies will not be rapidly produced upon reexposure to sars-cov-2. memory b cells specific for the spike and nucleocapsid proteins of sars-cov-2 last for at least six months after the appearance of symptoms.[328] as of august 2021, reinfection with covid\u201119 was possible but uncommon. the first case of reinfection was documented in august 2020.[329] a systematic review found 17 cases of confirmed reinfection in medical literature as of may 2021.[329] with the omicron variant, as of 2022, reinfections have become common, albeit it is unclear how common.[330] covid-19 reinfections are thought to likely be less severe than primary infections, especially if one was previously infected by the same variant.[330][additional citation(s) needed] mortality main articles: covid-19 pandemic and covid-19 pandemic death rates by country several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.[331] these numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the volume of testing, healthcare system quality, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, sex, and overall health.[332] the mortality rate reflects the number of deaths within a specific demographic group divided by the population of that demographic group. consequently, the mortality rate reflects the prevalence as well as the severity of the disease within a given population. mortality rates are highly correlated to age, with relatively low rates for young people and relatively high rates among the elderly.[333][334][335] in fact, one relevant factor of mortality rates is the age structure of the countries' populations. for example, the case fatality rate for covid\u201119 is lower in india than in the us since india's younger population represents a larger percentage than in the us.[336] case fatality rate the case fatality rate (cfr) reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a given time interval. based on johns hopkins university statistics, the global death-to-case ratio is 1.02% (6,881,955/676,609,955) as of 10 march 2023.[337] the number varies by region.[338][339] total confirmed cases over time total confirmed cases of covid\u201119 per million people[340] total confirmed deaths over time total confirmed deaths due to covid\u201119 per million people[341] infection fatality rate a key metric in gauging the severity of covid\u201119 is the infection fatality rate (ifr), also referred to as the infection fatality ratio or infection fatality risk.[342][343][344] this metric is calculated by dividing the total number of deaths from the disease by the total number of infected individuals; hence, in contrast to the cfr, the ifr incorporates asymptomatic and undiagnosed infections as well as reported cases.[345] estimates the red line shows the estimate of infection fatality rate (ifr), in percentage terms, as a function of age. the shaded region depicts the 95% confidence interval for that estimate. markers denotes specific observations used in the meta-analysis.[346] the same relationship plotted on a log scale a december 2020 systematic review and meta-analysis estimated that population ifr during the first wave of the pandemic was about 0.5% to 1% in many locations (including france, netherlands, new zealand, and portugal), 1% to 2% in other locations (australia, england, lithuania, and spain), and exceeded 2% in italy.[346] that study also found that most of these differences in ifr reflected corresponding differences in the age composition of the population and age-specific infection rates; in particular, the metaregression estimate of ifr is very low for children and younger adults (e.g., 0.002% at age 10 and 0.01% at age 25) but increases progressively to 0.4% at age 55, 1.4% at age 65, 4.6% at age 75, and 15% at age 85.[346] these results were also highlighted in a december 2020 report issued by the who.[347] ifr estimate per age group(to december 2020)[346] age group ifr 0\u201334 0.004% 35\u201344 0.068% 45\u201354 0.23% 55\u201364 0.75% 65\u201374 2.5% 75\u201384 8.5% 85 + 28.3% an analysis of those ifr rates indicates that covid\u201119 is hazardous not only for the elderly but also for middle-aged adults, for whom the infection fatality rate of covid-19 is two orders of magnitude greater than the annualised risk of a fatal automobile accident and far more dangerous than seasonal influenza.[346] earlier estimates of ifr at an early stage of the pandemic, the world health organization reported estimates of ifr between 0.3% and 1%.[348][349] on 2 july, the who's chief scientist reported that the average ifr estimate presented at a two-day who expert forum was about 0.6%.[350][351] in august, the who found that studies incorporating data from broad serology testing in europe showed ifr estimates converging at approximately 0.5\u20131%.[352] firm lower limits of ifrs have been established in a number of locations such as new york city and bergamo in italy since the ifr cannot be less than the population fatality rate. (after sufficient time however, people can get reinfected).[353] as of 10 july, in new york city, with a population of 8.4 million, 23,377 individuals (18,758 confirmed and 4,619 probable) have died with covid\u201119 (0.3% of the population).[354] antibody testing in new york city suggested an ifr of \u22480.9%,[355] and \u22481.4%.[356] in bergamo province, 0.6% of the population has died.[357] in september 2020, the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) reported preliminary estimates of age-specific ifrs for public health planning purposes.[358] sex differences main article:

parentheses are 95% credible intervals for the estimates. covid\u201119 case fatality rates are higher among men than women in most countries. however, in a few countries like india, nepal, vietnam, and slovenia the fatality cases are higher in women than men.[336] globally, men are more likely to be admitted to the icu and more likely to die.[360][361] one meta-analysis found that globally, men were more likely to get covid\u201119 than women; there were approximately 55 men and 45 women per 100 infections (ci: 51.43\u201356.58).[362] the chinese center for disease control and prevention reported the death rate was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.[363] later reviews in june 2020 indicated that there is no significant difference in susceptibility or in cfr between genders.[364][365] one review acknowledges the different mortality rates in chinese men, suggesting that it may be attributable to lifestyle choices such as smoking and drinking alcohol rather than genetic factors.[366] smoking, which in some countries like china is mainly a male activity, is a habit that contributes to increasing significantly the case fatality rates among men.[336] sex-based immunological differences, lesser prevalence of smoking in women and men developing co-morbid conditions such as hypertension at a younger age than women could have contributed to the higher mortality in men.[367] in europe as of february 2020, 57% of the infected people were men and 72% of those died with covid\u201119 were men.[368] as of april 2020, the us government is not tracking sex-related data of covid\u201119 infections.[369] research has shown that viral illnesses like ebola, hiv, influenza and sars affect men and women differently.[369] ethnic differences in the us, a greater proportion of deaths due to covid\u201119 have occurred among african americans and other minority groups.[370] structural factors that prevent them from practising social distancing include their concentration in crowded substandard housing and in \"essential\" occupations such as retail grocery workers, public transit employees, health-care workers and custodial staff. greater prevalence of lacking health insurance and care of underlying conditions such as diabetes,[371] hypertension, and heart disease also increase their risk of death.[372] similar issues affect native american and latino communities.[370] on the one hand, in the dominican republic there is a clear example of both gender and ethnic inequality. in this latin american territory, there is great inequality and precariousness that especially affects dominican women, with greater emphasis on those of haitian descent.[373] according to a us health policy non-profit, 34% of american indian and alaska native people (aian) non-elderly adults are at risk of serious illness compared to 21% of white non-elderly adults.[374] the source attributes it to disproportionately high rates of many health conditions that may put them at higher risk as well as living conditions like lack of access to clean water.[375] leaders have called for efforts to research and address the disparities.[376] in the uk, a greater proportion of deaths due to covid\u201119 have occurred in those of a black, asian, and other ethnic minority background.[377][378][379] more severe impacts upon patients including the relative incidence of the necessity of hospitalisation requirements, and vulnerability to the disease has been associated via dna analysis to be expressed in genetic variants at chromosomal region 3, features that are associated with european neanderthal heritage. that structure imposes greater risks that those affected will develop a more severe form of the disease.[380] the findings are from professor svante p\u00e4\u00e4bo and researchers he leads at the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology and the karolinska institutet.[380] this admixture of modern human and neanderthal genes is estimated to have occurred roughly between 50,000 and 60,000 years ago in southern europe.[380] comorbidities biological factors (immune response) and the general behaviour (habits) can strongly determine the consequences of covid\u201119.[336] most of those who die of covid\u201119 have pre-existing (underlying) conditions, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus,[371] and cardiovascular disease.[381] according to march data from the united states, 89% of those hospitalised had preexisting conditions.[382] the italian istituto superiore di sanit\u00e0 reported that out of 8.8% of deaths where medical charts were available, 96.1% of people had at least one comorbidity with the average person having 3.4 diseases.[281] according to this report the most common comorbidities are hypertension (66% of deaths), type 2 diabetes (29.8% of deaths), ischaemic heart disease (27.6% of deaths), atrial fibrillation (23.1% of deaths) and chronic renal failure (20.2% of deaths). most critical respiratory comorbidities according to the us centers for disease control and prevention (cdc), are: moderate or severe asthma, pre-existing copd, pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis.[383] evidence stemming from meta-analysis of several smaller research papers also suggests that smoking can be associated with worse outcomes.[384][385] when someone with existing respiratory problems is infected with covid\u201119, they might be at greater risk for severe symptoms.[386] covid\u201119 also poses a greater risk to people who misuse opioids and amphetamines, insofar as their drug use may have caused lung damage.[387] in august 2020, the cdc issued a caution that tuberculosis (tb) infections could increase the risk of severe illness or death. the who recommended that people with respiratory symptoms be screened for both diseases, as testing positive for covid\u201119 could not rule out co-infections. some projections have estimated that reduced tb detection due to the pandemic could result in 6.3 million additional tb cases and 1.4 million tb-related deaths by 2025.[388] history this section needs to be updated. the reason given is: excessive

origin, most likely through spillover infection.[96][389][390] a joint-study conducted in early 2021 by the people's republic of china and the world health organization indicated that the virus descended from a coronavirus that infects wild bats, and likely spread to humans through an intermediary wildlife host.[391] there are several theories about where the index case originated and investigations into the origin of the pandemic are ongoing.[392] according to articles published in july 2022 in science, virus transmission into humans occurred through two spillover events in november 2019 and was likely due to live wildlife trade on the huanan wet market in the city of wuhan (hubei, china).[393][394][395] doubts about the conclusions have mostly centered on the precise site of spillover.[396] earlier phylogenetics estimated that sars-cov-2 arose in october or november 2019.[397][398][399] a phylogenetic algorithm analysis suggested that the virus may have been circulating in guangdong before wuhan.[400] most scientists believe the virus spilled into human populations through natural zoonosis, similar to the sars-cov-1 and mers-cov outbreaks, and consistent with other pandemics in human history.[401][402] according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change several social and environmental factors including climate change, natural ecosystem destruction and wildlife trade increased the likelihood of such zoonotic spillover.[403][404] one study made with the support of the european union found climate change increased the likelihood of the pandemic by influencing distribution of bat species.[405][406] available evidence suggests that the sars-cov-2 virus was originally harboured by bats, and spread to humans multiple times from infected wild animals at the huanan seafood market in wuhan in december 2019.[401][402] a minority of scientists and some members of the u.s intelligence community believe the virus may have been unintentionally leaked from a laboratory such as the wuhan institute of virology.[407][408] the us intelligence community has mixed views on the issue,[409][410] but overall agrees with the scientific consensus that the virus was not developed as a biological weapon and is unlikely to have been genetically engineered.[411][412][413][414] there is no evidence sars-cov-2 existed in any laboratory prior to the pandemic.[415][416][417] the first confirmed human infections were in wuhan. a study of the first 41 cases of confirmed covid\u201119, published in january 2020 in the lancet, reported the earliest date of onset of symptoms as 1 december 2019.[418][419][420] official publications from the who reported the earliest onset of symptoms as 8 december 2019.[421] human-to-human transmission was confirmed by the who and chinese authorities by 20 january 2020.[422][423] according to official chinese sources, these were mostly linked to the huanan seafood wholesale market, which also sold live animals.[424] in may 2020, george gao, the director of the cdc, said animal samples collected from the seafood market had tested negative for the virus, indicating that the market was the site of an early superspreading event, but that it was not the site of the initial outbreak.[425] traces of the virus have been found in wastewater samples that were collected in milan and turin, italy, on 18 december 2019.[426] by december 2019, the spread of infection was almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.[363][427] the number of covid-19 cases in hubei gradually increased, reaching sixty by 20 december,[428] and at least 266 by 31 december.[429] on 24 december, wuhan central hospital sent a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (bal) sample from an unresolved clinical case to sequencing company vision medicals. on 27 and 28 december, vision medicals informed the wuhan central hospital and the chinese cdc of the results of the test, showing a new coronavirus.[430] a pneumonia cluster of unknown cause was observed on 26 december and treated by the doctor zhang jixian in hubei provincial hospital, who informed the wuhan jianghan cdc on 27 december.[431] on 30 december, a test report addressed to wuhan central hospital, from company capitalbio medlab, stated an erroneous positive result for sars, causing a group of doctors at wuhan central hospital to alert their colleagues and relevant hospital authorities of the result. the wuhan municipal health commission issued a notice to various medical institutions on \"the treatment of pneumonia of unknown cause\" that same evening.[432] eight of these doctors, including li wenliang (punished on 3 january),[433] were later admonished by the police for spreading false rumours and another, ai fen, was reprimanded by her superiors for raising the alarm.[434] the wuhan municipal health commission made the first public announcement of a pneumonia outbreak of unknown cause on 31 december, confirming 27 cases[435][436][437] \u2013 enough to trigger an investigation.[438] during the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.[439] in early and mid-january 2020, the virus spread to other chinese provinces, helped by the chinese new year migration and wuhan being a transport hub and major rail interchange.[101] on 20 january, china reported nearly 140 new cases in one day, including two people in beijing and one in shenzhen.[440] later official data shows 6,174 people had already developed symptoms by then,[363] and more may have been infected.[441] a report in the lancet on 24 january indicated human transmission, strongly recommended personal protective equipment for health workers, and said testing for the virus was essential due to its \"pandemic potential\".[137][442] on 30 january, the who declared covid-19 a public health emergency of international concern.[441] by this time, the outbreak spread by a factor of 100 to 200 times.[443] italy had its first confirmed cases on 31 january 2020, two tourists from china.[444] italy overtook china as the country with the most deaths on 19 march 2020.[445] by 26 march the united states had overtaken china and italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world.[446] research on coronavirus genomes indicates the majority of covid-19 cases in new york came from european travellers, rather than directly from china or any other asian country.[447] retesting of prior samples found a person in france who had the virus on 27 december 2019,[448][449] and a person in the united states who died from the disease on 6 february 2020.[450] rt-pcr testing of untreated wastewater samples from brazil and italy have suggested detection of sars-cov-2 as early as november and december 2019, respectively, but the methods of such sewage studies have not been optimised, many have not been peer-reviewed, details are often missing, and there is a risk of false positives due to contamination or if only one gene target is detected.[451] a september 2020 review journal article said, \"the possibility that the covid\u201119 infection had already spread to europe at the end of last year is now indicated by abundant, even if partially circumstantial, evidence\", including pneumonia case numbers and radiology in france and italy in november and december.[452] as of 1 october 2021[update], reuters reported that it had estimated the worldwide total number of deaths due to covid\u201119 to have exceeded five million.[453] the public health emergency of international concern for covid-19 ended on may 5, 2023. by this time, everyday life in most countries had returned to how it was before the pandemic.[454][455] misinformation main article: covid-19 misinformation after the initial outbreak of covid\u201119, misinformation and disinformation regarding the origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of the disease rapidly spread online.[456][457][458] in september 2020, the us centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) published preliminary estimates of the risk of death by age groups in the united states, but those estimates were widely misreported and misunderstood.[459][460] other species see also: impact of the covid-19 pandemic on animals humans appear to be capable of spreading the virus to some other animals,[461][462] a type of disease transmission referred to as zooanthroponosis.[463][464] some pets, especially cats and ferrets, can catch this virus from infected humans.[465][466] symptoms in cats include respiratory (such as a cough) and digestive symptoms.[465] cats can spread the virus to other cats, and may be able to spread the virus to humans, but cat-to-human transmission of sars-cov-2 has not been proven.[465][467] compared to cats, dogs are less susceptible to this infection.[467] behaviours which increase the risk of transmission include kissing, licking, and petting the animal.[467] the virus does not appear to be able to infect pigs, ducks, or chickens at all.[465] mice, rats, and rabbits, if they can be infected at all, are unlikely to be involved in spreading the virus.[467] tigers and lions in zoos have become infected as a result of contact with infected humans.[467] as expected, monkeys and great ape species such as orangutans can also be infected with the covid\u201119 virus.[467] minks, which are in the same family as ferrets, have been infected.[467] minks may be asymptomatic, and can also spread the virus to humans.[467] multiple countries have identified infected animals in mink farms.[468] denmark, a major producer of mink pelts, ordered the slaughter of all minks over fears of viral mutations,[468] following an outbreak referred to as cluster 5. a vaccine for mink and other animals is being researched.[468] research further information: covid-19 drug development international research on vaccines and medicines in covid\u201119 is underway by government organisations, academic groups, and industry researchers.[469][470] the cdc has classified it to require a bsl3 grade laboratory.[471] there has been a great deal of covid\u201119 research, involving accelerated research processes and publishing shortcuts to meet the global demand.[472] as of december 2020[update], hundreds of clinical trials have been undertaken, with research happening on every continent except antarctica.[473] as of november 2020[update], more than 200 possible treatments have been studied in humans.[474] transmission and prevention research further information: covid-19 vaccine modelling research has been conducted with several objectives, including predictions of the dynamics of transmission,[475] diagnosis and prognosis of infection,[476] estimation of the impact of interventions,[477][478] or allocation of resources.[479] modelling studies are mostly based on compartmental models in epidemiology,[480] estimating the number of infected people over time under given conditions. several other types of models have been developed and used during the covid\u201119 pandemic including computational fluid dynamics models to study the flow physics of covid\u201119,[481] retrofits of crowd movement models to study occupant exposure,[482] mobility-data based models to investigate transmission,[483] or the use of macroeconomic models to assess the economic impact of the pandemic.[484] treatment-related research main article: covid-19 drug repurposing research seven possible drug targets in viral replication process and drugs repurposed antiviral drugs make up most of the research into covid\u201119 treatments.[485][486] other candidates in trials include vasodilators, corticosteroids, immune therapies, lipoic acid, bevacizumab, and recombinant angiotensin-converting enzyme 2.[486] in march 2020, the world health organization (who) initiated the solidarity trial to assess the treatment effects of some promising drugs: an experimental drug called remdesivir; anti-malarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine; two anti-hiv drugs, lopinavir/ritonavir; and interferon-beta.[487][488] more than 300 active clinical trials are underway as of april 2020.[70] research on the antimalarial drugs hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine showed that they were ineffective at best,[489][490] and that they may reduce the antiviral activity of remdesivir.[491] by may 2020[update], france, italy, and belgium had banned the use of hydroxychloroquine as a covid\u201119 treatment.[492] in june, initial results from the randomised recovery trial in the united kingdom showed that dexamethasone reduced mortality by one third for people who are critically ill on ventilators and one fifth for those receiving supplemental oxygen.[493] because this is a well-tested and widely available treatment, it was welcomed by the who, which is in the process of updating treatment guidelines to include dexamethasone and other steroids.[494][495] based on those preliminary results, dexamethasone treatment has been recommended by the nih for patients with covid\u201119 who are mechanically ventilated or who require supplemental oxygen but not in patients with covid\u201119 who do not require supplemental oxygen.[496] in september 2020, the who released updated guidance on using corticosteroids for covid\u201119.[497][498] the who recommends systemic corticosteroids rather than no systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of people with severe and critical covid\u201119 (strong recommendation, based on moderate certainty evidence).[497] the who suggests not to use corticosteroids in the treatment of people with non-severe covid\u201119 (conditional recommendation, based on low certainty evidence).[497] the updated guidance was based on a meta-analysis of clinical trials of critically ill covid\u201119 patients.[499][500] in september 2020, the european medicines agency (ema) endorsed the use of dexamethasone in adults and adolescents from twelve years of age and weighing at least 40 kilograms (88 lb) who require supplemental oxygen therapy.[501][502] dexamethasone can be taken by mouth or given as an injection or infusion (drip) into a vein.[501] in november 2020, the us food and drug administration (fda) issued an emergency use authorisation for the investigational monoclonal antibody therapy bamlanivimab for the treatment of mild-to-moderate covid\u201119.[503] bamlanivimab is authorised for people with positive results of direct sars-cov-2 viral testing who are twelve years of age and older weighing at least 40 kilograms (88 lb), and who are at high risk for progressing to severe covid\u201119 or hospitalisation.[503] this includes those who are 65 years of age or older, or who have chronic medical conditions.[503] in february 2021, the fda issued an emergency use authorisation (eua) for bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together for the treatment of mild to moderate covid\u201119 in people twelve years of age or older weighing at least 40 kilograms (88 lb) who test positive for sars\u2011cov\u20112 and who are at high risk for progressing to severe covid\u201119. the authorised use includes treatment for those who are 65 years of age or older or who have certain chronic medical conditions.[504] in april 2021, the fda revoked the emergency use authorisation (eua) that allowed for the investigational monoclonal antibody therapy bamlanivimab, when administered alone, to be used for the treatment of mild-to-moderate covid\u201119 in adults and certain paediatric patients.[505] cytokine storm various therapeutic strategies for targeting cytokine storm a cytokine storm can be a complication in the later stages of severe covid\u201119. a cytokine storm is a potentially deadly immune reaction where a large amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines are released too quickly. a cytokine storm can lead to ards and multiple organ failure.[506] data collected from jin yin-tan hospital in wuhan, china indicates that patients who had more severe responses to covid\u201119 had greater amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in their system than patients who had milder responses. these high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines indicate presence of a cytokine storm.[507] tocilizumab has been included in treatment guidelines by china's national health commission after a small study was completed.[508][509] it is undergoing a phase ii non-randomised trial at the national level in italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease.[510][511] combined with a serum ferritin blood test to identify a cytokine storm (also called cytokine storm syndrome, not to be confused with cytokine release syndrome), it is meant to counter such developments, which are thought to be the cause of death in some affected people.[512] the interleukin-6 receptor (il-6r) antagonist was approved by the fda to undergo a phase iii clinical trial assessing its effectiveness on covid\u201119 based on retrospective case studies for the treatment of steroid-refractory cytokine release syndrome induced by a different cause, car t cell therapy, in 2017.[513] there is no randomised, controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an efficacious treatment for crs. prophylactic tocilizumab has been shown to increase serum il-6 levels by saturating the il-6r, driving il-6 across the blood\u2013brain barrier, and exacerbating neurotoxicity while having no effect on the incidence of crs.[514] lenzilumab, an anti-gm-csf monoclonal antibody, is protective in murine models for car t cell-induced crs and neurotoxicity and is a viable therapeutic option due to the observed increase of pathogenic gm-csf secreting t cells in hospitalised patients with covid\u201119.[515] passive antibodies overview of the application and use of convalescent plasma therapy transferring purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune systems of those who have recovered from covid\u201119 to people who need them is being investigated as a non-vaccine method of passive immunisation.[516][517][needs update] viral neutralisation is the anticipated mechanism of action by which passive antibody therapy can mediate defence against sars-cov-2. the spike protein of sars-cov-2 is the primary target for neutralising antibodies.[518] as of 8 august 2020, eight neutralising antibodies targeting the spike protein of sars-cov-2 have entered clinical studies.[519] it has been proposed that selection of broad-neutralising antibodies against sars-cov-2 and sars-cov might be useful for treating not only covid\u201119 but also future sars-related cov infections.[518] other mechanisms, however, such as antibody-dependant cellular cytotoxicity or phagocytosis, may be possible.[516] other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are in development.[516] the use of passive antibodies to treat people with active covid\u201119 is also being studied. this involves the production of convalescent serum, which consists of the liquid portion of the blood from people who recovered from the infection and contains antibodies specific to this virus, which is then administered to active patients.[516] this strategy was tried for sars with inconclusive results.[516] an updated cochrane review in feb 2023 found high certainty evidence that, for the treatment of people with moderate to severe covid\u201119, convalescent plasma did not reduce mortality or bring about symptom improvement.[517] there continues to be uncertainty about the safety of convalescent plasma administration to people with covid\u201119 and differing outcomes measured in different studies limits their use in determining efficacy.[517] bioethics since the outbreak of the covid\u201119 pandemic, scholars have explored the bioethics, normative economics, and political theories of healthcare policies related to the public health crisis.[520] academics have pointed to the moral distress of healthcare workers, ethics of distributing scarce healthcare resources such as ventilators,[521] and the global justice of vaccine diplomacies.[citation needed] the socio-economic inequalities between genders,[522] races,[523] groups with disabilities,[524] communities,[525] regions, countries,[526] and continents have also drawn attention in academia and the general public. see also coronavirus diseases, a group of closely

[...] mask use has been found to be safe and is not associated with clinically significant impacts on respiration or gas exchange under most circumstances, except for intense exercise. the limited available data indicate no clear evidence that masking impairs emotional or language development in children. [i]n combination with other contextual cues, masks are unlikely to produce serious impairments of children's social interactions. a study of 2-year-old children concluded that they were able to recognize familiar words presented without a mask and when hearing words through opaque masks. among children with autism spectrum disorders (asd), interventions including positive reinforcement and coaching caregivers to teach mask-wearing have improved participants' ability to wear a face mask. these findings suggest that even children who may have difficulty wearing a mask can do so effectively through targeted interventions. ^ jefferson t, dooley l, ferroni e, al-ansary la, van driel ml, bawazeer ga, et al.

frequently asked questions contact us to givemake a donation patient care & health information diseases & conditions diabetes request an appointment symptoms &causesdiagnosis &treatmentdoctors &departmentscare atmayo clinic print overviewdiabetes mellitus refers to a group of diseases that affect how the body uses blood sugar (glucose). glucose is an important source of energy for the cells that make up the muscles and tissues. it's also the brain's main source of fuel. the main cause of diabetes varies by type. but no matter what type of diabetes you have, it can lead to excess sugar in the blood. too much sugar in the blood can lead to serious health problems. chronic diabetes conditions include type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. potentially reversible diabetes conditions include prediabetes and gestational diabetes. prediabetes happens when blood sugar levels are higher than normal. but the blood sugar levels aren't high enough to be called diabetes. and prediabetes can lead to diabetes unless steps are taken to prevent it. gestational diabetes happens during pregnancy. but it may go away after the baby is born.products & servicesa book: the essential diabetes book symptomsdiabetes symptoms depend on how high your blood sugar is. some people, especially if they have prediabetes, gestational diabetes or type 2 diabetes, may not have symptoms. in type 1 diabetes, symptoms tend to come on quickly and be more severe. some of the symptoms of type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes are: feeling more thirsty than usual. urinating often. losing weight without trying. presence of ketones in the urine. ketones are a byproduct of the breakdown of muscle and fat that happens when there's not enough available insulin. feeling tired and weak. feeling irritable or having other mood changes. having blurry vision. having slow-healing sores. getting a lot of infections, such as gum, skin and vaginal infections. type 1 diabetes can start at any age. but it often starts during childhood or teen years. type 2 diabetes, the more common type, can develop at any age. type 2 diabetes is more common in people older than 40. but type 2 diabetes in children is increasing. when to see a doctor if you think you or your child may have diabetes. if you notice any possible diabetes symptoms, contact your health care provider. the earlier the condition is diagnosed, the sooner treatment can begin. if you've already been diagnosed with diabetes. after you receive your diagnosis, you'll need close medical follow-up until your blood sugar levels stabilize. request an

information you requested in your inbox. sorry something went wrong with your subscription please, try again in a couple of minutes retry causesto understand diabetes, it's important to understand how the body normally uses glucose. how insulin worksinsulin is a hormone that comes from a gland behind and below the stomach (pancreas). the pancreas releases insulin into the bloodstream. the insulin circulates, letting sugar enter the cells. insulin lowers the amount of sugar in the bloodstream. as the blood sugar level drops, so does the secretion of insulin from the pancreas. the role of glucoseglucose \u2014 a sugar \u2014 is a source of energy for the cells that make up muscles and other tissues. glucose comes from two major sources: food and the liver. sugar is absorbed into the bloodstream, where it enters cells with the help of insulin. the liver stores and makes glucose. when glucose levels are low, such as when you haven't eaten in a while, the liver breaks down stored glycogen into glucose. this keeps your glucose level within a typical range. the exact cause of most types of diabetes is unknown. in all cases, sugar builds up in the bloodstream. this is because the pancreas doesn't produce enough insulin. both type 1 and type 2 diabetes may be caused by a combination of genetic or environmental factors. it is unclear what those factors may be. risk factorsrisk factors for diabetes depend on the type of diabetes. family history may play a part in all types. environmental factors and geography can add to the risk of type 1 diabetes. sometimes family members of people with type 1 diabetes are tested for the presence of diabetes immune system cells (autoantibodies). if you have these autoantibodies, you have an increased risk of developing type 1 diabetes. but not everyone who has these autoantibodies develops diabetes. race or ethnicity also may raise your risk of developing type 2 diabetes. although it's unclear why, certain people \u2014 including black, hispanic, american indian and asian american people \u2014 are at higher risk. prediabetes, type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes are more common in people who are overweight or obese. complicationslong-term complications of diabetes develop gradually. the longer you have diabetes \u2014 and the less controlled your blood sugar \u2014 the higher the risk of complications. eventually, diabetes complications may be disabling or even life-threatening. in fact, prediabetes can lead to type 2 diabetes. possible complications include: heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease. diabetes majorly increases the risk of many heart problems. these can include coronary artery disease with chest pain (angina), heart attack, stroke and narrowing of arteries (atherosclerosis). if you have diabetes, you're more likely to have heart disease or stroke. nerve damage from diabetes (diabetic neuropathy). too much sugar can injure the walls of the tiny blood vessels (capillaries) that nourish the nerves, especially in the legs. this can cause tingling, numbness, burning or pain that usually begins at the tips of the toes or fingers and gradually spreads upward. damage to the nerves related to digestion can cause problems with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation. for men, it may lead to erectile dysfunction. kidney damage from diabetes (diabetic nephropathy). the kidneys hold millions of tiny blood vessel clusters (glomeruli) that filter waste from the blood. diabetes can damage this delicate filtering system. eye damage from diabetes (diabetic retinopathy). diabetes can damage the blood vessels of the eye. this could lead to blindness. foot damage. nerve damage in the feet or poor blood flow to the feet increases the risk of many foot complications. skin and mouth conditions. diabetes may leave you more prone to skin problems, including bacterial and fungal infections. hearing impairment. hearing problems are more common in people with diabetes. alzheimer's disease. type 2 diabetes may increase the risk of dementia, such as alzheimer's disease. depression related to diabetes. depression symptoms are common in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. complications of gestational diabetesmost women who have gestational diabetes deliver healthy babies. however, untreated or uncontrolled blood sugar levels can cause problems for you and your baby. complications in your baby can be caused by gestational diabetes, including: excess growth. extra glucose can cross the placenta. extra glucose triggers the baby's pancreas to make extra insulin. this can cause your baby to grow too large. it can lead to a difficult birth and sometimes the need for a c-section. low blood sugar. sometimes babies of mothers with gestational diabetes develop low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) shortly after birth. this is because their own insulin production is high. type 2 diabetes later in life. babies of mothers who have gestational diabetes have a higher risk of developing obesity and type 2 diabetes later in life. death. untreated gestational diabetes can lead to a baby's death either before or shortly after birth. complications in the mother also can be caused by gestational diabetes, including: preeclampsia. symptoms of this condition include high blood pressure, too much protein in the urine, and swelling in the legs and feet. gestational diabetes. if you had gestational diabetes in one pregnancy, you're more likely to have it again with the next pregnancy. preventiontype 1 diabetes can't be prevented. but the healthy lifestyle choices that help treat prediabetes, type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes can also help prevent them: eat healthy foods. choose foods lower in fat and calories and higher in fiber. focus on fruits, vegetables and whole grains. eat a variety to keep from feeling bored. get more physical activity. try to get about 30 minutes of moderate aerobic activity on most days of the week. or aim to get at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity a week. for example, take a brisk daily walk. if you can't fit in a long workout, break it up into smaller sessions throughout the day. lose excess pounds. if you're overweight, losing even 7% of your body weight can lower the risk of diabetes. for example, if you weigh 200 pounds (90.7 kilograms), losing 14 pounds (6.4 kilograms) can lower the risk of diabetes. but don't try to lose weight during pregnancy. talk to your provider about how much weight is healthy for you to gain during pregnancy. to keep your weight in a healthy range, work on long-term changes to your eating and exercise habits. remember the benefits of losing weight, such as a healthier heart, more energy and higher self-esteem. sometimes drugs are an option. oral diabetes drugs such as metformin (glumetza, fortamet, others) may lower the risk of type 2 diabetes. but healthy lifestyle choices are important. if you have prediabetes, have your blood sugar checked at least once a year to make sure you haven't developed type 2 diabetes. by mayo clinic staff diabetes care at mayo clinic request an appointment diagnosis & treatment sept. 15,

in people with type 1 diabetes, the onset of symptoms can be very sudden, while in type 2 diabetes, they tend to come about more gradually, and sometimes there are no signs at all. symptoms sometimes occur after a viral illness. in some cases, a person may reach the point of diabetic ketoacidosis (dka) before a type 1 diagnosis is made. dka occurs when blood glucose (blood sugar) is dangerously high and the body can't get nutrients into the cells because of the absence of insulin. the body then breaks down muscle and fat for energy, causing an accumulation of ketones in the blood and urine. symptoms of dka include a fruity odor on the breath, heavy, taxed breathing and vomiting. if left untreated, dka can result in stupor, unconsciousness, and even death. people who have symptoms\u2014of type 1 or of dka\u2014should contact their health care provider immediately for an accurate diagnosis. keep in mind that these symptoms could signal other problems, too. some people with type 1 have a \"honeymoon\" period, a brief remission of symptoms while the pancreas is still secreting some insulin. the honeymoon phase usually occurs after someone has started taking insulin. a honeymoon can last as little as a week or even up to a year. but it\u2019s important to know that the absence of symptoms doesn't mean the diabetes is gone. the pancreas will eventually be unable to secrete insulin, and, if untreated, the symptoms will return. symptoms of type 1 diabetes onset in an infant or child the young child who is urinating frequently, drinking large quantities, losing weight, and becoming more and more tired and ill is the classic picture of a child with new-onset type 1 diabetes. if a child who is potty-trained and dry at night starts having accidents and wetting the bed again, diabetes might be the culprit. although it is easy to make the diagnosis diabetes in a child by checking blood glucose (blood sugar) at the doctor\u2019s office or emergency room, the tricky part is recognizing the symptoms and knowing to take the child to get checked. raising the awareness that young children, including infants, can get type 1 diabetes can help parents know when to check for type 1 diabetes. sometimes children can be in diabetic ketoacidosis (dka) when they are diagnosed with diabetes. when there is a lack of insulin in the body, the body can build up high levels of an acid called ketones. dka is a medical emergency that usually requires hospitalization and immediate care with insulin and iv fluids. after diagnosis and early in treatment, some children may go through a phase where they seem to be making enough insulin again. this is commonly called the \u201choneymoon phase.\" it may seem like diabetes has been cured, but over time they will require appropriate doses of insulin to keep their blood glucose levels in the normal range. symptoms of type 1 diabetes onset in adults when an adult is diagnosed with diabetes, they are often mistakenly told that they have type 2 diabetes. this is because there may be a lack of understanding by some doctors that type 1 diabetes can start at any age, and in people of every race, shape, and size. people with type 1 diabetes who have elevated blood glucose (blood sugar) and classic risk factors for type 2 diabetes, such as being overweight or physically inactive, are often misdiagnosed. it can also be tricky because some adults with new-onset type 1 diabetes are not sick at first. their doctor finds an elevated blood glucose level at a routine visit and starts them on diet, exercise, and an oral medication. maybe it's a different type if you or someone you know is diagnosed with type 2 diabetes but isn\u2019t responding well to the typical treatments for type 2 diabetes, it may be worth a visit to an endocrinologist to determine what type of diabetes is happening. generally, this requires antibody tests and possibly the measurement of a c-peptide level. gestational diabetes women with gestational diabetes often have no symptoms, which is why it's important for at-risk women to be tested at the proper time during pregnancy. learn more symptoms of diabetes complications have you already been diagnosed with diabetes but are concerned about symptoms that may be the result of complications related to diabetes?

request appointment diabetes symptoms: when diabetes symptoms are a concern print sections products and services diabetes symptoms: when diabetes symptoms are a concerndiabetes symptoms can be hard to spot. here's what to look for and when to get care.by mayo clinic staff many people have diabetes but don't know it. that's why the american diabetes association (ada) recommends that most adults begin diabetes screening at age 35. the ada advises diabetes screening before age 35 for those who are overweight and have additional risk factors for prediabetes or type 2 diabetes. testing for diabetes also should take place for anyone who has early symptoms of diabetes. but those symptoms aren't always easy to notice. in fact, symptoms can develop so slowly that people may have type 2 diabetes for years before they're diagnosed with the disease. if you notice the following symptoms, make an appointment to get care: being very thirsty. urinating often. being much more tired than usual. having blurry vision. losing weight without trying. recognizing possible diabetes symptoms can lead to early diagnosis and treatment. that can help prevent complications of diabetes and lead to a lifetime of better health. here are more details about possible symptoms of diabetes: greater thirst and more urination being very thirsty and urinating often are common diabetes symptoms. in people who have diabetes, extra sugar \u2014 which also is called glucose \u2014 builds up in the blood. this forces the kidneys to work overtime to filter and absorb the extra sugar. when the kidneys can't keep up, extra sugar goes into the urine. and it takes along fluids from the body's tissues. that causes dehydration, which usually leads to a feeling of thirst. drinking more fluids to quench the thirst then leads to more urination. fatigue diabetes can make you feel very tired. this is called fatigue. it happens because high blood sugar disrupts the body's ability to use sugar for energy. dehydration from increased urination also can leave you feeling tired. weight loss when you lose sugar through frequent urination, you also lose calories. along with dehydration, this can cause rapid weight loss. that's especially true in people who have type 1 diabetes. but it also can happen in some people with type 2 diabetes. people newly diagnosed with diabetes may gain some weight right away as a result of better hydration. then over time, because less sugar is being lost in urine, weight gain may continue unless steps are taken to prevent it. blurry vision diabetes symptoms sometimes involve eyesight. high levels of blood sugar pull fluid from the body's tissues, including the lenses of the eyes. this affects the eyes' ability to focus. with diabetes treatment and better control of blood sugar, the eyes' ability to focus usually returns and blurry vision goes away. if it's not treated, diabetes can cause new blood vessels to form in the retina \u2014 the back part of the eye. that can damage other blood vessels. for most people, these early changes don't cause vision problems. however, if the changes aren't found and they get worse, they may lead to vision problems and, eventually, blindness. slow-healing sores or frequent infections high levels of blood sugar can cause poor blood flow and damage the body's natural healing process. because of this, people with diabetes may notice slow-healing sores, especially on the feet. in women with diabetes, bladder and vaginal yeast infections may happen more often. tingling and numbness in the hands and feet although it's a less common symptom, tingling and a loss of sensation, called numbness, can happen in the hands and feet of people with diabetes. that's because too much blood sugar can affect the way nerves work. burning pain in the arms, hands, legs and feet also may happen. red, swollen, tender gums diabetes may weaken the body's ability to fight germs. that raises the risk of infection in the gums and in the bones that hold the teeth in place. this can lead to another less common diabetes symptom when the gums pull away from the teeth. the teeth then may become loose, and sores or pockets of pus may develop in the gums. take your body's hints seriously if you notice any possible symptoms of diabetes, contact a member of your health care team. diabetes is a serious condition. the earlier it's diagnosed, the sooner treatment can begin. with active participation and support from a health care team, people with diabetes often can successfully manage the disease and enjoy active, healthy lives. there is a problem with information submitted for this request. review/update the information highlighted below and resubmit the form. from mayo clinic to your inbox sign up for free and stay

addison's disease, the adrenal glands make too little cortisol and, often, too little of another hormone, aldosterone. addison's disease can affect anyone and can be life-threatening. treatment involves taking hormones to replace those that are missing.products & servicesa book: mayo clinic family health book, 5th editionnewsletter: mayo clinic health letter \u2014 digital editionshow more

adrenal glands located on top of each kidney, the adrenal glands make hormones that help regulate metabolism, the immune system, blood pressure and other important functions. although small, these glands control much of what happens in the body. addison's disease is caused by damage to the adrenal glands. the adrenal glands sit just above the kidneys. as part of the endocrine system, they make hormones that affect almost every organ and tissue in the body. damage to these glands results in too little of the hormone cortisol and, often, the hormone aldosterone. the adrenal glands are made up of two sections. the interior, called the medulla, makes adrenaline-like hormones. the outer layer, called the cortex, makes a group of hormones called corticosteroids. corticosteroids include: glucocorticoids. these hormones, including cortisol, affect the body's ability to turn food into energy. they also play a role in the immune system's inflammatory response and help the body respond to stress. mineralocorticoids. these hormones, including aldosterone, balance the body's sodium and potassium to keep blood pressure in a healthy range. androgens. in all people, the adrenal glands make small amounts of these sex hormones. they cause male sexual development. and they affect muscle mass, sex drive, known as libido, and a sense of well-being in all people. primary adrenal insufficiencysometimes, the outer layer of the adrenal glands, known as the cortex, is damaged. then it can't make enough hormones, a condition called primary adrenal insufficiency. this is usually the result of an autoimmune disease, in which the body attacks itself. people with addison's disease are more likely than are other people to have another autoimmune disease as well. other causes of adrenal gland failure may include: tuberculosis other infections of the adrenal glands spread of cancer to the adrenal glands bleeding into the adrenal glands secondary adrenal insufficiencythe pituitary gland makes a hormone called adrenocorticotropic hormone (acth). acth in turn causes the adrenal cortex to make its hormones. having pituitary tumors that aren't cancer, inflammation and pituitary surgery can cause the pituitary gland to make too little acth. too little acth can cause the adrenal glands to make too little glucocorticoids and androgens. this is called secondary adrenal insufficiency. most symptoms of secondary adrenal insufficiency are similar to those of primary adrenal insufficiency. however, people with secondary adrenal insufficiency don't have darkened skin and are less likely to have severe dehydration or low blood pressure. they're more likely to have low blood sugar. a temporary cause of secondary adrenal insufficiency occurs when people who take corticosteroids, such as prednisone, to treat conditions such as asthma or arthritis, stop taking the medicine suddenly rather than tapering off. complications addisonian crisis. if you have untreated addison's disease, you may develop an addisonian crisis as a result of stress on the body, such as injury, infection or illness. typically, the adrenal glands make two or three times the usual amount of cortisol in response to physical stress. with adrenal insufficiency, not being able to increase the amount of cortisol made as a result of stress can lead to an addisonian crisis. an addisonian crisis is a life-threatening situation that results in low blood pressure, low blood levels of sugar and high blood levels of potassium. it requires immediate medical care. other autoimmune diseases. people with addison's disease often have related autoimmune diseases. preventionaddison's disease can't be prevented, but there are ways to avoid an addisonian crisis: talk to your health care provider if you always feel tired or weak or are losing weight without trying. ask about an adrenal shortage. if you have been diagnosed with addison's disease, ask your provider what to do when you're sick. you may need to learn how to increase your dose of corticosteroids. if you become very sick, especially if you are vomiting and you can't take your medicine, go to an emergency room. some people with addison's disease worry about serious side effects from hydrocortisone or prednisone. however, people with addison's disease aren't as likely to get the side effects of high-dose glucocorticoids. that's because the dose prescribed replaces the amount that's missing. if you take cortisone, be sure to follow up with your provider regularly to make sure your dose is not too high.

downoverviewsymptoms and causesdiagnosis and testsmanagement and treatmentpreventionoutlook / prognosisliving withoverviewwhat is addison's disease?addison\u2019s disease is a chronic condition in which your adrenal glands don\u2019t produce enough of the hormones cortisol and aldosterone.your adrenal glands, also known as suprarenal glands, are small, triangle-shaped glands that are located on top of each of your two kidneys. they\u2019re a part of your endocrine system.cortisol is a hormone that helps your body respond to stress, including the stress of illness, injury or surgery. it also helps maintain your blood pressure, heart function, immune system and blood glucose (sugar) levels. cortisol is essential for life.aldosterone is a hormone that affects the balance of sodium (salt) and potassium in your blood. this in turn controls the amount of fluid your kidneys remove as urine (pee), which affects blood volume and blood pressure.addison\u2019s disease is also called primary adrenal insufficiency. a related disorder, secondary adrenal insufficiency, happens when your pituitary gland doesn\u2019t release enough adrenocorticotropic hormone (acth), which activates your adrenal glands to produce cortisol.advertisementcleveland clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. advertising on our site helps support our mission. we do not endorse non-cleveland clinic products or services. policywhat\u2019s the difference between addison's disease and cushing's syndrome?addison\u2019s disease happens when your body doesn\u2019t have enough cortisol (and aldosterone), whereas cushing\u2019s syndrome happens when your body has too much cortisol (hypercortisolism).who does addison\u2019s disease affect?addison\u2019s disease can affect people of all age groups, but it\u2019s most common in people 30 to 50 years old.people who have autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome, a rare, inherited condition in which your immune system mistakenly attacks many of your tissues and organs, are much more likely to have addison\u2019s disease. your mucous membranes, adrenal glands and parathyroid glands are commonly affected by this syndrome, though it can affect other types of tissues and organs.people who have the following autoimmune disease are also at higher risk of developing the autoimmune (most common) form of addison's disease:type i diabetes.pernicious anemia.graves' disease.chronic thyroiditis.dermatitis herpetiformis.vitiligo.myasthenia gravis.advertisementhow common is addison\u2019s disease?addison\u2019s disease is rare. in the united states, it affects 1 in 100,000 people.symptoms and causeswhat are the symptoms of addison\u2019s disease?with addison\u2019s disease, the damage to your adrenal glands usually happens slowly over time, so symptoms occur gradually. symptoms vary from person to person.symptoms of addison\u2019s disease include:steadily worsening fatigue (most common symptom).patches of dark skin (hyperpigmentation), especially around scars and skin creases and on your gums.abdominal pain.nausea and vomiting.diarrhea.loss of appetite and unintentional weight loss.muscle pain, muscle spasms and/or joint pain.dehydration.low blood pressure, which can cause lightheadedness or dizziness upon standing.changes in mood and behavior, such as irritability, depression and poor concentration.a craving for salty food.low blood sugar (hypoglycemia).people assigned female at birth with addison\u2019s disease may also have abnormal menstruation (periods), lose body hair and have a decreased sexual drive.in some cases \u2014 such as after an injury or severe illness or time of intense stress \u2014 symptoms can come on quickly and cause a life-threatening event called an addisonian crisis or acute adrenal failure.an addisonian crisis is a medical emergency. if it\u2019s not treated, it can lead to shock and death. symptoms of an addisonian crisis include:extreme weakness.sudden, severe pain in your lower back, belly or legs.feeling restless, confused, afraid or other mental changes.severe vomiting and diarrhea, potentially leading to dehydration.low blood pressure.loss of consciousness.get to the nearest hospital as soon as possible if you\u2019re having these symptoms.advertisementwhat causes addison\u2019s disease?the most common cause of addison\u2019s disease is an autoimmune response, which occurs when your immune system attacks healthy tissues for an unknown reason. with addison\u2019s disease, your immune system attacks the outer portion of your adrenal glands (the adrenal cortex), where they make cortisol and aldosterone. symptoms don\u2019t usually develop until 90% of the adrenal cortex has been damaged, which can take several months to years.approximately 75% of cases of addison\u2019s disease are due to an autoimmune attack. autoimmune addison\u2019s disease may happen by itself or as part of a rare, inherited syndrome, specifically autoimmune polyendocrine syndromes i (aps type-1) and ii (schmidt syndrome).in the past, tuberculosis was a major cause of addison\u2019s disease. it remains a prominent cause of the condition in developing countries.other less common causes of addison\u2019s disease include:repeated infections, including hiv/aids-related infections and fungal infections.when cancer cells from another part of your body invade your adrenal glands.bleeding (hemorrhaging) into your adrenal glands.surgical removal of your adrenal glands.amyloidosis (a condition in which amyloid proteins build up in vital organs, causing damage).diagnosis and testshow is addison\u2019s disease diagnosed?since symptoms of addison\u2019s disease usually develop slowly over time and are usually vague and common to many different conditions, it often leads to a delay in the proper diagnosis.healthcare providers often \u201caccidentally\u201d discover addison\u2019s disease when a routine blood test, such as a basic metabolic panel, shows low levels of sodium or high levels of potassium.dark patches on your skin are another common symptom that signals healthcare providers to test for addison\u2019s disease.if your provider suspects you may have addison\u2019s disease based on your symptoms, they\u2019ll order more tests to officially diagnose the condition.what tests will be done to diagnose addison\u2019s disease?to determine if you have addison\u2019s disease, your healthcare provider may order the following tests:blood tests: your provider will likely order certain tests to measure the levels of sodium, potassium, cortisol and acth in your blood.acth stimulation test: this test measures your adrenal glands\u2019 response after you\u2019re given a shot of artificial acth. if your adrenal glands produce low levels of cortisol after the shot, they may not be functioning properly.insulin-induced hypoglycemia test: your provider may order this test to determine if your symptoms are due to problems with your pituitary gland (secondary adrenal insufficiency) instead of your adrenal glands. this test measures blood sugar (glucose) levels before and after the injection of fast-acting insulin, which should lead to a drop in blood sugar (hypoglycemia) and a rise in cortisol.computed tomography (ct scan): computed tomography is an imaging test that uses computers to combine many x-ray images into cross-sectional views. your provider may order a ct scan to evaluate your adrenal glands and/or pituitary gland. for example, it can show if your immune system has damaged your adrenal glands or if the glands are infected.management and treatmenthow is addison\u2019s disease treated?addison\u2019s disease is treated by replacing the missing hormones, cortisol and aldosterone, with synthetic versions of them.cortisol is replaced by the drug hydrocortisone, and aldosterone is replaced by the drug fludrocortisone. addison\u2019s disease is a chronic condition, so you\u2019ll need to take medication for the rest of your life.the dosages of these medications are different for each person, and your healthcare provider may increase the dosage when you\u2019re experiencing an infection, trauma, surgery and other stressful situations to prevent an acute adrenal crisis.if you\u2019re taking fludrocortisone, your provider might tell you to increase your salt intake, especially in hot and humid weather and after vigorous exercise.care at cleveland clinicadrenal disorders treatmentfind a doctor and specialistsmake an appointmentpreventioncan addison\u2019s disease be prevented?unfortunately, there\u2019s nothing you can do to prevent addison\u2019s disease.outlook / prognosiswhat is the prognosis (outlook) for addison\u2019s disease?the prognosis for addison\u2019s disease is generally good. although people who have addison\u2019s disease will need to take medicine for the rest of their lives, they can live normal, healthy lives.the dosages of these medications, however, need to be closely monitored to prevent over- or under-treatment. over-treatment with glucocorticoids (hydrocortisone) may result in obesity, type 2 diabetes and osteoporosis. over-treatment with fludrocortisone can cause high blood pressure (hypertension).up to 50% of people with addison\u2019s disease develop another autoimmune condition.living withhow do i take care of myself if i have addison\u2019s disease?if you have addison\u2019s disease, you should carry an identification card and wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace at all times to let medical professionals know you have the condition in emergencies.talk to your healthcare provider about what you should do when you become sick or are experiencing intense stress since you\u2019ll likely need to increase your medication dosages.ask your provider about keeping a shot of cortisol for emergencies, and be sure someone with you knows how to give you the shot.when should i see my healthcare provider about addison\u2019s disease?if you have addison\u2019s disease, you\u2019ll need to see your healthcare provider (likely an endocrinologist) regularly to make sure your medication dosages are working for you.call your provider if you have major stress \u2014 such as an injury, illness or the death of a loved one \u2014 because you might need an adjustment to your medicine.seek medical attention right away if you have any of the symptoms of an addisonian crisis, such as sudden, extreme weakness and intense pain.a note from cleveland clinicreceiving a diagnosis of a chronic condition can be overwhelming and stressful. the good news is that addison\u2019s disease is treatable with medication. it\u2019s important to see your healthcare provider regularly to make sure your dosages are correct and to prevent an episode of acute adrenal failure. if you have any questions about managing addison\u2019s disease, talk to your provider. they\u2019re always available to help

sawchuk, ph.d., l.p., clinical psychologist at mayo clinic. show transcript for video what is depression? a mayo clinic expert explains. hi, i'm dr. craig sawchuk, a clinical psychologist at mayo clinic. and i'm here to talk with you about depression. whether you're looking for answers for yourself, a friend, or loved one, understanding the basics of depression can help you take the next step. what is depression? depression is a mood disorder that causes feelings of sadness that won't go away. unfortunately, there's a lot of stigma around depression. depression isn't a weakness or a character flaw. it's not about being in a bad mood, and people who experience depression can't just snap out of it. depression is a common, serious, and treatable condition. if you're experiencing depression, you're not alone. it honestly affects people of all ages and races and biological sexes, income levels and educational backgrounds. approximately one in six people will experience a major depressive episode at some point in their lifetime, while up to 16 million adults each year suffer from clinical depression. there are many types of symptoms that make up depression. emotionally, you may feel sad or down or irritable or even apathetic. physically, the body really slows down. you feel tired. your sleep is often disrupted. it's really hard to get yourself motivated. your thinking also changes. it can just be hard to concentrate. your thoughts tend to be much more negative. you can be really hard on yourself, feel hopeless and helpless about things. and even in some cases, have thoughts of not wanting to live. behaviorally, you just want to pull back and withdraw from others, activities, and day-to-day responsibilities. these symptoms all work together to keep you trapped in a cycle of depression. symptoms of depression are different for everyone. some symptoms may be a sign of another disorder or medical condition. that's why it's important to get an accurate diagnosis. what causes depression? while there's no single cause of depression, most experts believe there's a combination of biological, social, and psychological factors that contribute to depression risk. biologically, we think about genetics or a family history of depression, health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease or thyroid disorders, and even hormonal changes that happen over the lifespan, such as pregnancy and menopause. changes in brain chemistry, especially disruptions in neurotransmitters like serotonin, that play an important role in regulating many bodily functions, including mood, sleep, and appetite, are thought to play a particularly important role in depression. socially stressful and traumatic life events, limited access to resources such as food, housing, and health care, and a lack of social support all contribute to depression risk. psychologically, we think of how negative thoughts and problematic coping behaviors, such as avoidance and substance use, increase our vulnerability to depression. the good news is that treatment helps. effective treatments for depression exist and you do have options to see what works best for you. lifestyle changes that improve sleep habits, exercise, and address underlying health conditions can be an important first step. medications such as antidepressants can be helpful in alleviating depressive symptoms. therapy, especially cognitive behavioral therapy, teaches skills to better manage negative thoughts and improve coping behaviors to help break you out of cycles of depression. whatever the cause, remember that depression is not your fault and it can be treated. to help diagnose depression, your health care provider may use a physical exam, lab tests, or a mental health evaluation. these results will help identify various treatment options that best fit your situation. help is available. you don't have to deal with depression by yourself. take the next step and reach out. if you're hesitant to talk to a health care provider, talk to a friend or loved one about how to get help. living with depression isn't easy and you're not alone in your struggles. always remember that effective treatments and supports are available to help you start feeling better. want to learn more about depression? visit mayoclinic.org. do take care. depression is a mood disorder that causes a

emptymood changes are one of the most common symptoms of depression. a person who has depression may feel sad or low for extended periods.they may also say that they feel \u201cempty\u201d or unable

may have ongoing feelings of guilt for no reason. they may focus a lot of energy on this guilt and feel bad about themselves and things that they have said or done \u2014 even events that have long since passed.5. no interest or pleasure in activitiessome people with depression lose interest in things or activities that they used to enjoy. these can include sports, hobbies, going out with friends, music, or sexual activity. they may turn down offers to do activities or be with others, and they may not want to do things they used to like doing.this inability to feel pleasure during previously pleasurable activities is also known as anhedonia.6. anger and irritabilitya person with depression may seem to be angry with others. they may become easily annoyed and irritated.the national institutes of mental health state that among people with depression, males are more likely than females to experience irritability and anger. however, these symptoms can also occur in females.children and adolescents are more likely to display depression through anger, irritability, and tantrums.other depression symptoms can indirectly cause irritability. for example, if a person is not sleeping well and feels tired, they may be more prone to irritability.7. feeling tired and having a lack of energysome people with depression may find it hard to get up in the morning because they feel exhausted and run down. they may feel too fatigued to do everyday tasks, such as going to work and cooking meals. as a result, they may spend a lot of time at home resting or sleeping.the fatigue of depression can make a person feel as though they are always tired, even if they are getting enough sleep. however, sleep disturbances are also a symptom of depression, and a person who experiences these can feel even more tired.8. insomnia or lack of sleepsleep disturbances are a primary symptom of depression, and research has found that insomnia is an independent risk factor for developing depression.sometimes, a person with depression may be unable to sleep well and have trouble falling and staying asleep. they may stay up very late at night or wake up very early in the morning.9. difficulty concentrating, remembering, and making decisionsdepression can interfere with a person\u2019s cognitive abilities. they may have trouble focusing or concentrating on personal or professional matters. additionally, they may find it difficult to make decisions, even those involving seemingly minor, everyday choices.people with depression may also find that they cannot remember things as well as they did previously. they might forget appointments or commitments and not recall things that they said or did recently.10. lack of appetitepeople with depression may lose their desire and appetite for food, which can cause weight loss. they may have little interest in eating and go for long periods without food.11. overeating and weight gainconversely, some people with depression may eat more than usual. for some individuals, food can be a comfort mechanism for negative feelings and a way to deal with boredom or loneliness.depression can make it difficult for people to feel motivated to get outside or exercise. combined with an increase in food intake, this can cause weight gain.12. aches, pains, and physical symptomsa person with depression may experience

or suicidea person with depression may think more about death and dying. they may also think about suicide and how they could end their life. the term for this is suicidal ideation.sometimes, a person may tell others about these thoughts. if someone is talking about death or suicide, this could be their way of asking for help, and it is vital to seek assistance right away.depression is a common but serious condition that can be life threatening. not every person who thinks about suicide will attempt it. however, if someone mentions suicide, it is important either to contact a doctor or to help the person seek urgent medical care.diagnosishaving just one of the symptoms above does not mean that a person has depression. for instance, other health issues and some medications can cause weight gain or insomnia.however, people who have multiple symptoms and are concerned about depression should contact a doctor to discuss their mental health.there is no single test that can diagnose depression. usually, a medical professional will evaluate a person\u2019s symptoms and their personal and family medical history to make a diagnosis. they may also use specialized questionnaires and screening tools.treatmentmany people with depression use therapy, medication, or both to manage the symptoms. it is important to go to scheduled appointments and take medications as the doctor prescribes them.treatment can take time, and a person may not feel better straight away. antidepressants can take several weeks to work, and psychotherapy is an effective but long-term treatment that does not provide immediate symptom relief.some people with depression find that the following measures can help them manage their symptoms:exercisingspending time with supportive friends or loved onesavoiding alcohol and illegal drugstrying stress management techniquesbreaking significant tasks down into smaller onesif a friend or loved one is showing symptoms of depression, a person can help

condition that can cause a range of symptoms.anyone who is concerned that they or a loved one is experiencing symptoms of depression should speak with a doctor as soon as possible. proper care for depression can significantly improve quality of life and even be lifesaving. last medically reviewed on july 21, 2022depressionmental healthpsychology / psychiatryhow we reviewed this

major depressive disorder that typically arises during the fall and winter and goes away during the spring and summer.prenatal depression and postpartum depression: prenatal depression is depression

disorders.cancer.macular degeneration.chronic pain.advertisementhow common is depression?depression is common. researchers estimate that nearly 7% of adults in the united states have depression every year. more than 16% of u.s. adults \u2014 around 1 in 6 people \u2014 will experience depression at some point in their lifetime.however, researchers believe that these estimates are lower than

chemistry: an imbalance of neurotransmitters, including serotonin and dopamine, contributes to the development of depression.genetics: if you have a first-degree relative (biological parent or sibling) with depression, you\u2019re about three times as likely to develop the condition as the general population. however, you can have depression without a family history of it.stressful life events: difficult experiences, such as the death of a loved one, trauma, divorce, isolation and lack of support, can trigger depression.medical conditions: chronic pain and chronic conditions like diabetes can lead to depression.medication: some medications can cause depression as a side effect. substance use, including alcohol, can also cause depression or make it worse.diagnosis and testshow is depression diagnosed?healthcare providers diagnose depression based on a thorough understanding of your symptoms, medical history and mental health history. they may diagnose you with a specific type of depression, such as seasonal affective disorder or postpartum depression, based on the context of your symptoms.to receive a diagnosis of depression, you must have five depression symptoms every day, nearly all day, for at least two weeks.your provider may order medical tests, such as blood tests, to see if any underlying medical conditions are causing your depressive symptoms.management and treatmenthow is depression treated?depression is one of the most treatable mental health conditions. approximately 80% to 90% of people with depression who seek treatment

(other data counters this, and finds that the latter group is more likely to experience depression, especially as its members age.) socioeconomic factors, interpersonal issues, and concerns about racism tend to be major drivers of mental health for black individuals.depression is found to be less common among asians, and more common among hispanics and latinx people. the signs of depression may differ between racial and ethnic groups. understanding these differences can help people and their healthcare professionals better identify and treat the condition.determining whether persistent dark feelings are the result of depression can be the first step toward healing and recovery. the following signs indicate that it\u2019s time to see a mental health professional.1. hopeless outlookpeople who are depressed often experience feelings of hopelessness, though this is not the same across all races and ethnicities.hispanic and latino individuals are the most likely to report feeling hopeless \u201call or most of the time,\u201d followed by people of two or more races, according to a recent national health interview survey. sometimes people who are depressed feel like they are worthless, a sentiment that the survey found most common among people of two or more races, as well as american indians and alaska natives. native hawaiians and pacific islanders are most likely to feel like \u201ceverything is an effort, all the time,\u201d followed by black or african-american individuals.some people who live with depression also experience inappropriate guilt. they may often think, \u201cit\u2019s all my fault,\u201d or \u201cwhat\u2019s the point?\u201dloneliness and isolation are among the top three reasons people describe themselves as having poor mental health, as reported by more than 1 million people who screened themselves for depression and anxiety on mental health america\u2019s website in 2020. for hispanic/latinx people, it was cited as the biggest cause of mental health issues.2. loss of interestdepression can take the pleasure or enjoyment out of the things people love. a loss of interest in or withdrawal from activities that were previously looked forward to \u2014 sports, hobbies, going out with friends \u2014 is frequently a sign of major depression. in 2020, a whopping 90% of people who identified with more than one race reported symptoms of depression to mental health america. another study of 25,503 older americans found that black and hispanic individuals were 1.5 to 2 times more likely than white people to experience sadness and a loss of interest in everyday life.losing interest in sex is common. symptoms of major depression include a decreased sex drive and even impotence.learn more about types of depression, symptoms, and causes. 3. increased fatigue and sleep problemspart of the reason that people living with depression might stop doing things they enjoy is because they feel very tired. depression often comes with a lack of energy and an overwhelming feeling of fatigue, which can be among its most debilitating symptoms. this can lead to excessive sleeping.asian and pacific islander people (particularly those from older age groups) may report feeling tired or sleepy rather than depressed, as the latter can be seen as less culturally acceptable. because these symptoms can be attributed to other conditions, including chronic fatigue syndrome, healthcare professionals may miss the true cause.depression is also linked to insomnia, and they can feed off each other. a lack of restful sleep may lead to anxiety. 4. anxietydepression and anxiety often occur together. symptoms of anxiety can include: nervousness, restlessness, or a sense of tensionfeelings of danger, panic, or dreadrapid heart raterapid breathingincreased or heavy sweatingtrembling or muscle twitchingtrouble focusing or thinking clearly about anything other than one central preoccupationnative americans and american indians were most likely to report high levels of anxiety in mental health america\u2019s 2020 screenings. their rate of moderate to severe depression also increased sharply after 2019. 5. irritability (in men)depression can affect the sexes differently. research shows that men with depression may also experience irritability, escapist or risky behavior, substance abuse, or misplaced anger.overall, men are less likely than women to recognize depression or seek treatment for that condition. they are more likely to get help when their symptoms resemble \u201ctraditional\u201d depression but may not identify their irritability or other strong feelings as something requiring treatment, according to a 2018 study. women are about twice as likely to take antidepressant medication as men, with the most frequent users being those over 60, according to the most recent national health and nutrition examination survey. white people are also far more likely to take antidepressants than black, hispanic, or asian individuals.men, for their part, prefer medicine to talk therapy when they get treatment, a 2020 studyfound. 6. changes in appetite and weightweight and appetite can fluctuate for people with depression. this experience may be different for each person. some people will have an increased appetite and gain weight, while others won\u2019t be hungry and will lose weight. one indication of whether dietary changes are related to depression is if they\u2019re intentional or not. if they\u2019re not, it may mean that they\u2019re caused by depression. 7. uncontrollable emotionsone moment it\u2019s an outburst of anger. the next, tears are flowing uncontrollably. depression can cause mood swings that fluctuate wildly, and it has nothing to do with anything outside of the person experiencing them. 8. looking at deathdepression is sometimes connected to suicide. in 2020, nearly 46,000 people died from suicide in the united states, according to the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc). black people are less likely to die by suicide than white people, but black teenagers are more likely to attempt suicide than white teenagers. statisticians were surprised to note a significant decrease in the number of people who died by suicide in 2019 and 2020, after years of increases. in 2020 alone, the number of white females who died by suicide dropped 10%, while the number of white males doing so decreased 3%. the number of asian men dying by suicide also dropped in 2020.at the same time, some groups saw increases. in 2020, the number of hispanic men dying by suicide rose 5%, while the number of black and american indian men dying this way also rose. according to the cdc, american indian and native american people are far more likely to die by suicide than any other group, followed by white people. in mental health america\u2019s online screenings, 46% of american indians and native americans reported thinking about suicide or self-harm in 2020, and the number of those having such thoughts increased 7.5% over 2019. this reflected the largest jump in suicidal ideation from any racial or ethnic group surveyed.those who die by suicide usually show symptoms of depression or mental health issues first. often people will talk about it or make a first attempt before succeeding in ending their lives. when people are at immediate risk of self-harm or hurting others, those around them should:call 911 or a local emergency number.stay with the person until help arrives.remove any guns, knives, medications, or other potentially dangerous items.listen, but don\u2019t judge, argue, threaten, or yell getting helpdepression affects millions of people, but there are myriad options available for treatment, from lifestyle changes to medications. no matter what path one follows, asking for professional help is a critical first step toward starting to feel better.what that help looks like may differ across communities of color and other marginalized groups. because \u201ctraditional\u201d depression symptoms can vary by race and ethnicity \u2014 and some people are reluctant to report their symptoms \u2014 often, individuals in these communities go undiagnosed.the reasons for anxiety and depression in each community also differ, and they are not static. in mental health america\u2019s 2020 screenings, white people said coronavirus played the biggest role in negatively affecting their mental health. but black people cited financial matters as a primary concern, while hispanic/latinx people were deeply affected by loneliness/isolation, and native americans impacted by trauma, loss, and relationship issues (also a major concern for asian or pacific islanders).people in these racial and ethnic groups are typically less likely to be screened for depression and don\u2019t receive mental healthcare treatment as often as those who are white. healthcare professionals who work with people experiencing depression must tailor their approach to address differences among those of varying ethnicities and races. using a cultural accommodation model(cam) may help bridge the gap. cam helps these professionals adjust their viewfinder when diagnosing and treating conditions, urging them to be more culturally appropriate and sensitive to the unique characteristics of these populations.\u00bbmore:open lines of communication: the 11 best online couples therapy platforms last medically reviewed on february 24, 2023how we reviewed this article:sourceshistoryhealthline has

learn more about depression? depression what is depression? depression (also known as major depression, major depressive disorder, or clinical depression) is a common but serious mood disorder. it causes severe symptoms that affect how a person feels, thinks, and handles daily activities, such as sleeping, eating, or working.to be diagnosed with depression, the symptoms must be present for at least 2 weeks.there are different types of depression, some of which develop due to specific circumstances.major depression includes symptoms of depressed mood or loss of interest, most of the time for at least 2 weeks, that interfere with daily activities.persistent depressive disorder (also called dysthymia or dysthymic disorder) consists of less severe symptoms of depression that last much longer, usually for at least 2 years.perinatal depression is depression that occurs during or after pregnancy. depression that begins during pregnancy is prenatal depression and depression that begins after the baby is born is postpartum depression.seasonal affective disorder is depression that comes and goes with the seasons, with symptoms typically starting in the late fall and early winter and going away during the spring and summer.depression with symptoms of psychosis is a severe form of depression in which a person experiences psychosis symptoms, such as delusions (disturbing, false fixed beliefs) or hallucinations (hearing or seeing things others do not hear or see).people with bipolar disorder (formerly called manic depression or manic-depressive illness) also experience depressive episodes, during which they feel sad, indifferent, or hopeless, combined with a very low activity level. but a person with bipolar disorder also experiences manic (or less severe hypomanic) episodes, or unusually elevated moods, in which they might feel very happy, irritable, or \u201cup,\u201d with a marked increase in activity level.other types of depressive disorders found in the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fifth edition (dsm-5) include disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (diagnosed in children and adolescents) and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (that affects women around the time of their period). who gets depression? depression can affect people of all ages, races, ethnicities, and genders. women are diagnosed with depression more often than men, but men can also be depressed. because men may be less likely to recognize, talk about, and seek help for their feelings or emotional problems, they are at greater risk of depression symptoms being undiagnosed or undertreated. studies also show higher rates of depression and an increased risk for the disorder among members of the lgbtqia+ community. what are the signs and symptoms of depression? if you have been experiencing some of the following signs and symptoms, most of the day, nearly every day, for at least 2 weeks, you may be experiencing depression:persistent sad, anxious, or \u201cempty\u201d moodfeelings of hopelessness or pessimismfeelings of irritability, frustration, or restlessnessfeelings of guilt, worthlessness, or helplessnessloss of interest or pleasure in hobbies and activitiesdecreased energy, fatigue, or feeling slowed downdifficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisionsdifficulty sleeping, waking early in the morning, or oversleepingchanges in appetite or unplanned weight changesphysical aches or pains, headaches, cramps, or digestive problems that do not have a clear physical cause and do not go away with treatmentthoughts of death or suicide or suicide attemptsnot everyone who is depressed experiences every one of these symptoms. some people experience only a few symptoms, while others experience many symptoms. symptoms associated with depression interfere with day-to-day functioning and cause significant distress for the person experiencing them.depression can also involve other changes in mood or behavior that include:increased anger or irritabilityfeeling restless or on edgebecoming withdrawn, negative, or detachedincreased engagement in high-risk activitiesgreater impulsivityincreased use of alcohol or drugsisolating from family and friendsinability to meet the responsibilities of work and family or ignoring other important rolesproblems with sexual desire and performancedepression can look different in men and women. although men, women, and people of all genders can feel depressed, how they express those symptoms and the behaviors they use to cope with them may differ. for example, some men (as well as women) may show symptoms other than sadness, instead seeming angry or irritable. and although increased use of alcohol or drugs can be a coping strategy for any person with depression, men may be more likely to use alcohol or drugs to help them cope.in some cases, mental health symptoms appear as physical problems. for example, a racing heart, tightened chest, ongoing headaches, or digestive issues. men are often more likely to see a health care provider about these physical symptoms than their emotional ones.because depression tends to make people think more negatively about themselves and the world, some people may also have thoughts of suicide or self-harm.several persistent symptoms, in addition to low mood, are required for a diagnosis of depression, but people with only a few symptoms may also benefit from treatment. the severity and frequency of symptoms and how long they last will vary depending on the person, the illness, and the stage of the illness.if you experience signs or symptoms of depression and they persist or do not go away, talk to a health care provider. if you see signs or symptoms of depression in someone you know, encourage them to seek help from a mental health professional.if you or someone you know is struggling or having thoughts of suicide, call or text the 988 suicide and crisis lifeline at 988 or chat at 988lifeline.org . in life-threatening situations, call 911. what are the risk factors for depression? depression is one of the most common mental disorders in the united states. research suggests that genetic, biological, environmental, and psychological factors play a role in depression. depression can happen at any age, but it often begins in adulthood. depression is now recognized as occurring in children and adolescents, although children may express more irritability than sadness. many chronic mood and anxiety disorders in adults begin as high levels of anxiety in childhood. depression, especially in midlife or older age, can co-occur with other serious medical illnesses, such as diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and parkinson\u2019s disease. these conditions are often worse when depression is present, and research suggests that people with depression and other medical illnesses tend to have more severe symptoms of both illnesses. the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) has also recognized that having certain mental disorders, including depression and schizophrenia, can make people more likely to get severely ill from covid-19. sometimes a physical health problem, such as thyroid disease, or medications taken for a physical illness cause side effects that contribute to depression. a health care provider experienced in treating these complicated illnesses can help work out the best treatment strategy. learn more about getting help and finding a health care provider. other risk factors for depression include: personal or family history of depression major negative life changes, trauma, or stress how is depression treated? depression, even the most severe cases, can be treated. the earlier treatment begins, the more effective it is. depression is usually treated with medication, psychotherapy, or a combination of the two. some people may experience treatment-resistant depression, which occurs when a person does not get better after trying at least two antidepressant medications. if treatments like medication and psychotherapy do not reduce depressive symptoms or the need for rapid relief from symptoms is urgent, brain stimulation therapy may be an option to explore. quick tip: no two people are affected the same way by depression, and there is no \"one-size-fits-all\" treatment. finding the treatment that works best for you may take trial and error. medications antidepressants are medications commonly used to treat depression. they work by changing how the brain produces or uses certain chemicals involved in mood or stress. you may need to try several different antidepressants before finding the one that improves your symptoms and has manageable side effects. a medication that has helped you or a close family member in the past will often be considered first. antidepressants take time\u2014usually 4\u20138 weeks\u2014to work, and problems with sleep, appetite, and concentration often improve before mood lifts. it is important to give a medication a chance to work before deciding whether it\u2019s the right one for you. new medications, such as intranasal esketamine, can have rapidly acting antidepressant effects, especially for people with treatment-resistant depression. esketamine is a medication approved by the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) for treatment-resistant depression. delivered as a nasal spray in a doctor\u2019s office, clinic, or hospital, it acts rapidly, typically within a couple of hours, to relieve depression symptoms. people who use esketamine will usually continue taking an oral antidepressant to maintain the improvement in their symptoms. another option for treatment-resistant depression is to take an antidepressant alongside a different type of medication that may make the antidepressant more effective, such as an antipsychotic or anticonvulsant medication. further research is needed to identify the best role of these newer medications in routine practice. if you begin taking an antidepressant, do not stop taking it without talking to a health care provider. sometimes people taking antidepressants feel better and stop taking the medications on their own, and their depression symptoms return. when you and your health care provider have decided it is time to stop a medication, usually after a course of 9\u201312 months, the provider will help you slowly and safely decrease your dose. abruptly stopping a medication can cause withdrawal symptoms. note: in some cases, children, teenagers, and young adults under 25 years may experience an increase in suicidal thoughts or behavior when taking antidepressants, especially in the first few weeks after starting or when the dose is changed. the fda advises that patients of all ages taking antidepressants be watched closely, especially during the first few weeks of treatment. if you are considering taking an antidepressant and are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or breastfeeding, talk to a health care provider about any health risks to you or your unborn or nursing child and how to weigh those risks against the benefits of available treatment options. to find the latest information about antidepressants, talk to a health care provider and visit the fda website . psychotherapies several types of psychotherapy (also called talk therapy or counseling) can help people with depression by teaching them new ways of thinking and behaving and how to change habits that contribute to depression. evidence-based approaches to treating depression include cognitive-behavioral therapy (cbt) and interpersonal therapy (ipt). learn more about psychotherapy. the growth of telehealth for mental health services, which offers an alternative to in-person therapy, has made it easier and more convenient for people to access care in some cases. for people who may have been hesitant to look for mental health care in the past, telemental health services might be an easier first step than traditional mental health services. brain stimulation therapies if medication or psychotherapy does not reduce symptoms of depression, brain stimulation therapy may be an option to explore. there are now several types of brain stimulation therapy, some of which have been authorized by the fda to treat depression. other brain stimulation therapies are experimental and still being investigated for treating mental disorders like depression. although brain stimulation therapies are less frequently used than medication and psychotherapy, they can play an important role in treating mental disorders in people who do not respond to other treatments. these therapies are used for most mental disorders only after medication and psychotherapy have been tried and usually continue to be used alongside these treatments. brain stimulation therapies act by activating or inhibiting the brain with electricity. the electricity is given directly through electrodes implanted in the brain or indirectly through electrodes placed on the scalp. the electricity can also be induced by applying magnetic fields to the head. the brain stimulation therapies with the largest bodies of evidence include: electroconvulsive therapy (ect) repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rtms) vagus nerve stimulation (vns) magnetic seizure therapy (mst) deep brain stimulation (dbs) ect and rtms are the most widely used brain stimulation therapies, with ect having the longest history of use. the other therapies are newer and, in some cases, still considered experimental. other brain stimulation therapies may also hold promise for treating specific mental disorders. ect, rtms, and vns have authorization from the fda to treat severe, treatment-resistant depression. they can be effective for people who have not been able to feel better with other treatments or for whom medications cannot be used safely and in severe cases where a rapid response is needed, such as when a person is catatonic, suicidal, or malnourished. whereas ect involves using electricity to induce seizures, in rtms, a magnet is used to activate the brain. unlike ect, in which stimulation is more generalized, in rtms, the stimulation is targeted to a specific brain site. both procedures are noninvasive and do not require surgery to perform. in contrast, vns is usually a surgical procedure that involves implanting a device under the skin to activate the vagus nerve. additional types of brain stimulation therapy are being investigated for treating depression and other mental disorders. learn more about these brain stimulation therapies. talk to a health care provider and make sure you understand the potential benefits and risks before undergoing brain stimulation therapy. alternative treatments the fda has not approved any natural products for depression. although research is ongoing, some people use natural products, including vitamin d and the herbal dietary supplement st. john\u2019s wort, for depression. however, these products can come with risks. for instance, dietary supplements and natural products can limit the effectiveness of some medications or interact in dangerous or even life-threatening ways with them. do not use vitamin d, st. john\u2019s wort, or other dietary supplements or natural products without talking to a health care provider. rigorous studies must be conducted to test whether these and other natural products are safe and effective. daily morning light therapy is a common treatment choice for people with seasonal affective disorder. light therapy devices are much brighter than ordinary indoor lighting and considered safe, except for people with certain eye diseases or taking medications that increase sensitivity to sunlight. as with all interventions for depression, evaluation, treatment, and follow-up by a health care provider are strongly recommended. research into the potential role of light therapy in treating non-seasonal depression is ongoing. how can i find help for depression? if you think you may have depression, start by making an appointment to see a health care provider. this could be your primary care provider; a psychiatrist, psychologist, or social worker; or another provider who specializes in diagnosing and treating mental health conditions. find tips to help prepare for and get the most out of your visit and information about getting help. once you enter treatment, you should gradually start to feel better. here are some other things you can do outside of treatment that may help you or a loved one during treatment for depression: try to get physical activity. just 30 minutes a day of walking can boost your mood. try to maintain a regular bedtime and wake-up time. eat regular, healthy meals. break up large tasks into small ones; do what you can as you can. decide what must get done and what can wait. try to connect with people. talk with people you trust about how you are feeling. delay making important decisions, such as getting married or divorced, or changing jobs until you feel better. discuss decisions with people who know you well. avoid using alcohol, nicotine, or drugs, including medications not prescribed for you. how can i find a clinical trial for depression? clinical trials are research studies that look at new ways to prevent, detect, or treat diseases and conditions, including depression. the goal of a clinical trial is to determine if a new test or treatment works and is safe. although people may benefit from being part of a clinical trial, they should know that the primary purpose is to gain new scientific knowledge so that others can be better helped in the future.researchers at nimh and around the country conduct many studies with patients with depression and healthy volunteers. we have new and better treatment options today because of what clinical trials have uncovered. talk to a health care provider about clinical trials, their benefits and risks, and whether one is right for you.to learn more or find a study, visit:clinical trials \u2013 information for participants: information about clinical trials,

cardiac arrest, also known as sudden cardiac arrest, is when the heart stops beating suddenly. the lack of blood flow to the brain and other organs can cause a person to lose consciousness, become disabled or die if not treated immediately. if a loved one experiences symptoms of cardiac arrest, call 911 immediately. many states require an automated external defibrillator (aed) to be available in public spaces. if you have access to an aed, follow the directions on the device to administer support until medical help has arrived. johns hopkins cardiologist and ventricular arrhythmia expert jonathan chrispin, m.d., explains symptoms, causes and treatments of cardiac arrest. what are the symptoms of cardiac arrest? in some cases of cardiac arrest, there may be no symptoms at all. you may experience these symptoms prior to cardiac arrest: fatigue dizziness shortness of breath nausea chest pain heart palpitations (fast or pounding heart beat) loss of consciousness symptoms of cardiac arrest can be life-threatening. call 911 or go to the er: if you have heart problems such as chest pains, dizziness, shortness of breath or sudden numbness, get help immediately. stay on top of your heart health if you have a new or existing heart problem, it's vital to see a doctor. our heart health checklist can help you determine when to seek care. check your heart health what causes cardiac arrest? cardiac arrest can be caused by a heart condition, or it can occur unexpectedly. however, there are three main causes of cardiac arrest: arrhythmia and ventricular fibrillation: arrhythmia occurs when electrical signals in the heart are the problem leading to an abnormal heartbeat. ventricular fibrillation is a type of arrhythmia and is the most common cause of cardiac arrest. ventricular fibrillation is a rapid heartbeat in the heart\u2019s ventricle, which causes the heart to tremble instead of normally pumping blood. enlarged heart (cardiomyopathy): the heart muscle dilates or thickens, leading to abnormal contractions of the heart. coronary artery disease: this type of heart disease occurs when the coronary arteries are narrowed and thickened by blockages of plaque, which restricts the flow of blood to the heart. if left untreated, coronary artery disease can lead to heart failure or arrhythmias, which both can lead to cardiac arrest. other causes of cardiac arrest may include: blood loss valvular heart disease lack of oxygen high levels of potassium and magnesium (can cause arrhythmia) am i at risk for cardiac arrest? several lifestyle and hereditary factors may increase the risk of cardiac arrest. they include the following: alcohol or drug abuse family history of heart disease or cardiac arrest heart disease high blood pressure high cholesterol low potassium or magnesium (nutritional deficiency) obesity smoking some people may experience cardiac arrest with no risk factors at all. cardiac arrest is more common in older men than women. what\u2019s the difference between cardiac arrest and a heart attack? the terms \u2018heart attack\u2019 and \u2018cardiac arrest\u2019 are often used interchangeably, but these are two different heart conditions. a heart attack occurs when there is a blockage in the arteries that stops blood flow in the heart. due to the lack of blood and oxygen flowing in the heart, the heart muscle tissue will become damaged. heart attacks can increase the risk for cardiac arrest because heart attacks can alter electrical signals in the heart. when cardiac arrest occurs suddenly with no other existing heart conditions, it\u2019s more likely to be caused by a heart attack. how is a cardiac arrest treated? if someone experiences cardiac arrest, they need immediate treatment to increase the flow of oxygen-rich blood to their organs. cardiopulmonary resuscitation the first line of treatment is usually cardiopulmonary resuscitation (cpr), during which another person compresses the chest to increase blood flow to the organs. cpr can temporarily treat cardiac arrest until more advanced emergency treatment is available to the person experiencing cardiac arrest. defibrillator once emergency medical service personnel arrive, they will use a machine called a defibrillator to send an electric shock to the heart to help it regain function and beat normally. this treatment should be used immediately to save the person\u2019s life and reduce further organ damage from oxygen and blood deprivation. defibrillators are used by trained first responders. some public areas may have an automated external defibrillator (aed), which is similar to a defibrillator, but an aed can detect harmful arrhythmias and deliver an electric shock to the heart. this device is designed for nonmedical personnel, and it can be used by anyone. once the patient is hospitalized, a doctor will run several tests to determine the cause of the cardiac arrest and treat the condition once diagnosed. patients may undergo surgical treatment or receive medication. what is the recovery process after cardiac arrest? cardiac arrest can lead to death if there is no treatment within minutes. this condition is one of the largest causes of natural death in the united states. after being released from the hospital, a doctor will provide guidelines for lifestyle changes, if needed, to reduce the risk of cardiac arrest or further complications. routine appointments may be scheduled with a cardiologist, who will examine the function of the heart\u2019s electrical system and develop a treatment plan to maintain normal electrical levels. how can i prevent cardiac arrest? you can reduce lifestyle factors that may increase your risk of cardiac arrest and other acquired heart diseases by: eating heart-healthy meals losing weight exercising quitting smoking and drug use reducing alcohol intake learn more about how you can prevent heart disease. cardiology at johns hopkins our world-renowned cardiologists at johns hopkins provide treatment, prevention and management for all kinds of heart conditions in the baltimore and washington, d.c., area. learn more find a treatment center heart and vascular institute find additional treatment centers at: howard county medical center sibley memorial hospital suburban hospital related pulmonary valve replacement: michelle's story infantile hemangioma ventricular tachycardia pericardiocentesis request an appointment find a doctor 443-997-0270 maryland 855-695-4872 outside of maryland +1-410-502-7683 international find a doctor see more related heart and vascular pulmonary valve replacement: michelle's story vascular abnormalities infantile hemangioma heart and vascular ventricular tachycardia related topics heart and vascular health conditions and diseases treatments, tests and therapies wellness and prevention caregiving johns hopkins medicine logo language assistance available: espa\u00f1ol \u12a0\u121b\u122d\u129b \u7e41\u9ad4\u4e2d\u6587 fran\u00e7ais tagalog \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 portugu\u00eas italiano ti\u1ebfng vi\u1ec7t \u0253\u00e0s\u0254\u0301\u0254\u0300-w\u00f9\u0256\u00f9-po-ny\u0254\u0300 igbo asusu \u00e8d\u00e8 yor\u00f9b\u00e1 \u09ac\u09be\u0982\u09b2\u09be \u65e5\u672c\u8a9e \ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4 krey\u00f2l ayisyen \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629 deutsch polski \u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac \u0a97\u0ac1\u0a9c\u0ab0\u0abe\u0aa4\u0ac0 \u0e20\u0e32\u0e29\u0e32\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22 \u0627\u064f\u0631\u062f\u064f\u0648 \u0641\u0627\u0631\u0633\u06cc \u0939\u093f\u0902\u0926\u0940 deitsch \u1781\u17d2\u1798\u17c2\u179a contact & privacy information contact us | patient care locations notice of privacy practices | privacy statement terms & conditions of use | non-discrimination notice copyright \u00a9 2023 the johns hopkins university, the johns hopkins hospital, and johns hopkins health system. all rights reserved. back to top button"

&treatmentdoctors &departmentscare atmayo clinic print overviewsudden cardiac arrest (sca) is the sudden loss of all heart activity due to an irregular heart rhythm. breathing stops. the person becomes unconscious. without immediate treatment, sudden cardiac arrest can lead to death. emergency treatment for sudden cardiac arrest includes cardiopulmonary resuscitation (cpr) and shocks to the heart with a device called an automated external defibrillator (aed). survival is possible with fast, appropriate medical care. sudden cardiac arrest isn't the same as a heart attack. a heart attack happens when blood flow to a part of the heart is blocked. sudden cardiac arrest is not due to a blockage. however, a heart attack can cause a change in the heart's electrical activity that leads to sudden cardiac arrest. symptomssymptoms of sudden cardiac arrest are immediate and severe and include: sudden collapse. no pulse. no breathing. loss of consciousness. sometimes other symptoms occur before sudden cardiac arrest. these might include: chest discomfort. shortness of breath. weakness. fast-beating, fluttering or pounding heart called palpitations. but sudden cardiac arrest often occurs with no warning. when to see a doctorwhen the heart stops, the lack of oxygen-rich blood can quickly cause death or permanent brain damage. call 911 or emergency medical services for these symptoms: chest pain or discomfort. feeling of a pounding heartbeat. rapid or irregular heartbeats. unexplained wheezing. shortness of breath. fainting or near fainting. lightheadedness or dizziness. if you see someone who's unconscious and not breathing, call 911 or local emergency services. then start cpr. the american heart association recommends doing cpr with hard and fast chest compressions. use an automated external defibrillator, called an aed, if one is available. how to do cprdo cpr if the person isn't breathing. push hard and fast on the person's chest \u2014 about 100 to 120 pushes a minute. if you've been trained in cpr, check the person's airway. then deliver rescue breaths after every 30 compressions. if you haven't been trained, just continue chest compressions. allow the chest to rise completely between compressions. keep doing this until an aed is available or emergency workers arrive. portable automated external defibrillators, called aeds, are available in many public places, including airports and shopping malls. you can also buy one for home use. aeds come with step-by-step voice instructions for their use. they're programmed to allow a shock only when

heart's electrical activity causes sudden cardiac arrest. the change makes the heart stop pumping blood. no blood flow goes to the body. how the heart beats chambers and valves of the heart enlarge image close chambers and valves of the heart chambers and valves of the heart a typical heart has two upper and two lower chambers. the upper chambers, the right and left atria, receive incoming blood. the lower chambers, the more muscular right and left ventricles, pump blood out of the heart. the heart valves, which keep blood flowing in the right direction, are gates at the chamber openings. to understand sudden cardiac arrest, it may help to know more about the heart's signaling system. electric signals in the heart control the rate and rhythm of the heartbeat. faulty or extra electrical signals can make the heart beat too fast, too slowly or in an uncoordinated way. changes in the heartbeat are called arrhythmias. some arrhythmias are brief and harmless. others can lead to sudden cardiac arrest. heart conditions that can lead to sudden cardiac arrestthe most common cause of sudden cardiac arrest is an irregular heart rhythm called ventricular fibrillation. rapid, erratic heart signals cause the lower heart chambers to quiver uselessly instead of pumping blood. certain heart conditions can make you more likely to have this type of heartbeat problem. however, sudden cardiac arrest can happen in people who have no known heart disease. heart conditions that can cause sudden cardiac arrest include: coronary artery disease. sudden cardiac arrest may occur if the heart arteries become clogged with cholesterol and other deposits, reducing blood flow to the heart. heart attack. if a heart attack occurs, often as a result of severe coronary artery disease, it can trigger ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac arrest. also, a heart attack can leave scar tissue in the heart. the scar tissue can cause changes in the heartbeat. enlarged heart called cardiomyopathy. this condition usually happens when the walls in the heart muscle stretch. the heart muscle gets bigger or thicker. heart valve disease. leaking or narrowing of the heart valves can lead to stretching or thickening of the heart muscle. when the chambers become enlarged or weakened because of stress caused by a tight or leaking valve, there's an increased risk of developing a heart rhythm problem. heart problem present at birth, called a congenital heart defect. sudden cardiac arrest in children or adolescents is often due to a heart problem that they're born with. adults who've had repair surgery for a congenital heart defect also have an increased risk of sudden cardiac arrest. long qt syndrome (lqts) and other heart signaling problems. conditions such as long qt syndrome and brugada syndrome cause the heart to beat in an unorganized way. if the heart rhythm isn't quickly restored, sudden death can occur. young people with lqts are especially at risk of sudden death. risk factorsthe same things that increase the risk of heart disease can raise the risk of sudden cardiac arrest. these include: a family history of coronary artery disease. smoking. high blood pressure. high blood cholesterol. obesity. diabetes. an inactive lifestyle. other things that might increase the risk of sudden cardiac arrest include: a previous episode of sudden cardiac arrest or a family history of it. a previous heart attack. a personal or family history of other forms of heart disease such as heart rhythm problems, heart failure and heart problems present at birth. growing older \u2014 the risk of sudden cardiac arrest increases with age. being male. using illegal drugs such as cocaine or amphetamines. low potassium or magnesium levels. a sleep disorder called obstructive sleep apnea. chronic kidney disease. complicationswhen sudden cardiac arrest occurs, less blood flows to the brain. if the heart rhythm isn't rapidly restored, complications may include brain damage and death.more informationsudden cardiac arrest care at mayo clinicsudden death in young people: heart problems often blamed preventionkeeping the heart healthy may help prevent sudden cardiac arrest. you can do this by: eating healthy. getting regular checkups. not smoking or using tobacco. being screened for heart disease. controlling blood pressure and cholesterol. genetic tests can be done to see if you have long qt syndrome, a common cause of sudden cardiac death. check with your insurer to see if it is covered. if you have the long qt gene, your health care provider may recommend that other family members also be tested. if you have a known risk of cardiac arrest, your health care provider might recommend a heart device called an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (icd). the device is placed under your collarbone. you also might consider purchasing an automated external defibrillator (aed) for home use. discuss this with your health care provider. aeds help reset the heart's rhythm when a person has sudden cardiac arrest. but they can be expensive and aren't always covered by health insurance. by mayo clinic staff sudden cardiac

airborne allergens, such as pollen, dust mites, mold spores, pet dander or particles of cockroach waste respiratory infections, such as the common cold physical activity cold air air pollutants and irritants, such as smoke certain medications, including beta blockers, aspirin, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen (advil, motrin ib, others) and naproxen sodium (aleve) strong emotions and stress sulfites and preservatives added to some types of foods and beverages, including shrimp, dried fruit, processed potatoes, beer and wine gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd), a condition in which stomach acids back up into your throat more informationasthma care at mayo clinicasthma and acid reflux risk factorsa number of factors are thought to increase your chances of developing asthma. they include: having a blood relative with asthma, such as a parent or sibling having another allergic condition, such as atopic dermatitis \u2014 which causes red, itchy skin \u2014 or hay fever \u2014 which causes a runny nose, congestion and itchy eyes being overweight being a smoker exposure to secondhand smoke exposure to exhaust fumes or other types of pollution exposure to occupational triggers, such as chemicals used in farming, hairdressing and manufacturing complicationsasthma complications include: signs and symptoms that interfere with sleep, work and other activities sick days from work or school during asthma flare-ups a permanent narrowing of the tubes that carry air to and from your lungs (bronchial tubes), which affects how well you can breathe emergency room visits and hospitalizations for severe asthma attacks side effects from long-term use of some medications used to stabilize severe asthma proper treatment makes a big difference in preventing both short-term and long-term complications caused by asthma. preventionwhile there's no way to prevent asthma, you and your doctor can design a step-by-step plan for living with your condition and preventing asthma attacks. follow your asthma action plan. with your doctor and health care team, write a detailed plan for taking medications and managing an asthma attack. then be sure to follow your plan. asthma is an ongoing condition that needs regular monitoring and treatment. taking control of your treatment can make you feel more in control of your life. get vaccinated for influenza and pneumonia. staying current with vaccinations can prevent flu and pneumonia from triggering asthma flare-ups. identify and avoid asthma triggers. a number of outdoor allergens and irritants \u2014 ranging from pollen and mold to cold air and air pollution \u2014 can trigger asthma attacks. find out what causes or worsens your asthma, and take steps to avoid those triggers. monitor your breathing. you may learn to recognize warning signs of an impending attack, such as slight coughing, wheezing or shortness of breath. but because your lung function may decrease before you notice any signs or symptoms, regularly measure and record your peak airflow with a home peak flow meter. a peak flow meter measures how hard you can breathe out. your doctor can show you how to monitor your peak flow at home. identify and treat attacks early. if you act quickly, you're less likely to have a severe attack. you also won't need as much medication to control your symptoms. when your peak flow measurements decrease and alert you to an oncoming attack, take your medication as instructed. also, immediately stop any activity that may have triggered the attack. if your symptoms don't improve, get medical help as directed in your action plan. take your medication as prescribed. don't change your medications without first talking to your doctor, even if your asthma seems to be improving. it's a good idea to bring your medications with you to each doctor visit. your doctor can make sure you're using your medications correctly and taking the right dose. pay attention to increasing quick-relief inhaler use. if you find yourself relying on your quick-relief inhaler, such as albuterol, your asthma isn't under control. see your doctor about adjusting your treatment. by

because the exact cause of asthma is unknown, you may not be able to prevent asthma in yourself or your children. you or your child may develop asthma when the body\u2019s immune system is still developing. research suggests that you may be able to take some steps to help prevent asthma from developing. they include doing your best to keep your home free of dampness and mold, avoiding air pollution as much as possible, and making a healthy weight a priority for you and your children. research for your health nhlbi-supported research on asthma has led to more and better treatment options to improve the health of people who have asthma. through our current research, we hope to better understand how our genes and the environment we live in affect our risk for developing asthma. learn more about our asthma research. what causes asthma? asthma often starts during childhood when your immune system is still developing. multiple factors may work together to cause it, such as: things in the environment (called allergens) that affected you as a baby or young child, which may include cigarette smoke or certain germs viral infections that affect breathing family history, such as a parent who has asthma (especially your mother) these can affect how your lung develops or how your body fights germs. other things that may raise the risk of developing asthma include the following. allergies: asthma is usually a type of allergic reaction. people who have asthma often have other types of allergies, such as food or pollen. obesity: this condition raises your chances of developing asthma or making your asthma symptoms worse. race or ethnicity: african americans and puerto ricans are at higher risk of asthma than people of other races or ethnicities are. african american and hispanic children are more likely than non-hispanic white americans to die from asthma-related causes. sex: more boys than girls have asthma as children, while asthma is more common among women in teens and adults. occupational hazards: breathing in chemicals or industrial dusts in the workplace can raise your risk of developing asthma. fact sheet asthma in our communities learn how asthma disproportionately affects different communities and steps for managing asthma. view the fact sheet asthma triggers asthma triggers are things that set off or make asthma symptoms worse. common triggers for asthma include: indoor allergens, such as dust mites, mold, and pet dander or fur outdoor allergens, such as pollens and mold emotional stress, such as intense anger, crying, or laughing physical activity, although with treatment, you or your child should still be able to be active infections, such as colds, influenza (flu), or covid-19 certain medicines, such as aspirin, which may cause serious breathing problems in people with severe asthma poor air quality or very cold air visit the managing asthma page to learn about avoiding triggers. book traversal links for causes and triggers previous asthma attack next diagnosis last updated on march 24, 2022 back to top link back to top web policies & notices accessibility no fear act data privacy policy freedom of information act (foia) hhs vulnerability disclosure related government websites health and human services national institutes of health office of the inspector general usa.gov stay connected live chat live chat with us, monday through friday, 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. est.get email alertsreceive automatic alerts about nhlbi related news and highlights from across the institute. footer bottom contact us site index jobs"

disease that affects your lungs. it\u2019s a chronic (ongoing) condition, meaning it doesn\u2019t go away and needs ongoing medical management.asthma affects more than 25 million people in the u.s. currently. this total includes more than 5 million children. asthma can be life-threatening if you don\u2019t get treatment.advertisementcleveland clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. advertising on our site helps support our mission. we do not endorse non-cleveland clinic products or services. policywhat is an asthma attack?when you breathe normally, muscles around your airways are relaxed, letting air move easily and quietly. during an asthma attack, three things can happen:bronchospasm: the muscles around the airways constrict (tighten). when they tighten, it makes your airways narrow. air cannot flow freely through constricted airways.inflammation: the lining of your airways becomes swollen. swollen airways don\u2019t let as much air in or out of your lungs.mucus production: during the attack, your body creates more mucus. this thick mucus clogs airways.when your airways get tighter, you make a sound called wheezing when you breathe, a noise your airways make when you breathe out. you might also hear an asthma attack called an exacerbation or a flare-up. it\u2019s the term for when your asthma isn\u2019t controlled.what types of asthma are there?asthma is broken down into types based on the cause and the severity of symptoms. healthcare providers identify asthma as:intermittent: this type of asthma comes and goes so you can feel normal in between asthma flares.persistent: persistent asthma means you have symptoms much of the time. symptoms can be mild, moderate or severe. healthcare providers base asthma severity on how often you have symptoms. they also consider how well you can do things during an attack.asthma has multiple causes:allergic: some people\u2019s allergies can cause an asthma attack. allergens include things like molds, pollens and pet dander.non-allergic: outside factors can cause asthma to flare up. exercise, stress, illness and weather may cause a flare.asthma can also be:adult-onset: this type of asthma starts after the age of 18.pediatric: also called childhood asthma, this type of asthma often begins before the age of 5, and can occur in infants and toddlers. children may outgrow asthma. you should make sure that you discuss it with your provider before you decide whether your child needs to have an inhaler available in case they have an asthma attack. your child\u2019s healthcare provider can help you understand the risks.in addition, there are these types of asthma:exercise-induced asthma: this type is triggered by exercise and is also called exercise-induced bronchospasm.occupational asthma: this type of asthma happens primarily to people who work around irritating substances.asthma-copd overlap syndrome (acos): this type happens when you have both asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd). both diseases make it difficult to breathe.advertisementwho can get asthma?anyone can develop asthma at any age. people with allergies or people exposed to tobacco smoke are more likely to develop asthma. this includes secondhand smoke (exposure to someone else who is smoking) and thirdhand smoke (exposure to clothing or surfaces in places where some has smoked).statistics show that people assigned female at birth tend to have asthma more than people assigned male at birth. asthma affects black people more frequently than other races.symptoms and causeswhat causes asthma?researchers don\u2019t know why some people have asthma while others don\u2019t. but certain factors present a higher risk:allergies: having allergies can raise your risk of developing asthma.environmental factors: people can develop asthma after exposure to things that irritate the airways. these substances include allergens, toxins, fumes and second- or third-hand smoke. these can be especially harmful to infants and young children whose immune systems haven\u2019t finished developing.genetics: if your family has a history of asthma or allergic diseases, you have a higher risk of developing the disease.respiratory infections: certain respiratory infections, such as respiratory syncytial virus (rsv), can damage young children\u2019s developing lungs.advertisementwhat are common asthma attack triggers?you can have an asthma attack if you come in contact with substances that irritate you. healthcare providers call these substances \u201ctriggers.\u201d knowing what triggers your asthma makes it easier to avoid asthma attacks.for some people, a trigger can bring on an attack right away. for other people, or at other times, an attack may start hours or days later.triggers can be different for each person. but some common triggers include:air pollution: many things outside can cause an asthma attack. air pollution includes factory emissions, car exhaust, wildfire smoke and more.dust mites: you can\u2019t see these bugs, but they are in our homes. if you have a dust mite allergy, this can cause an asthma attack.exercise: for some people, exercising can cause an attack.mold: damp places can spawn mold, which can cause problems if you have asthma. you don\u2019t even have to be allergic to mold to have an attack.pests: cockroaches, mice and other household pests can cause asthma attacks.pets: your pets can cause asthma attacks. if you\u2019re allergic to pet dander (dried skin flakes), breathing in the dander can irritate your airways.tobacco smoke: if you or someone in your home smokes, you have a higher risk of developing asthma. you should never smoke in enclosed places like the car or home, and the best solution is to quit smoking. your provider can help.strong chemicals or smells. these things can trigger attacks in some people.certain occupational exposures. you can be exposed to many things at your job, including cleaning products, dust from flour or wood, or other chemicals. these can all be triggers if you have asthma.what are the signs and symptoms of asthma?people with asthma usually have obvious symptoms. these signs and symptoms resemble many respiratory infections:chest tightness, pain or pressure.coughing (especially at night).shortness of breath.wheezing.with asthma, you may not have all of these symptoms with every flare. you can have different symptoms and signs at different times with chronic asthma. also, symptoms can change between asthma attacks.diagnosis and testshow do healthcare providers diagnose asthma?your healthcare provider will review your medical history, including information about your parents and siblings. your provider will also ask you about your symptoms. your provider will need to know any history of allergies, eczema (a bumpy rash caused by allergies) and other lung diseases.your provider may order spirometry. this test measures airflow through your lungs and is used to diagnose and monitor your progress with treatment. your healthcare provider may order a chest x-ray, blood test or skin test.management and treatmentwhat asthma treatment options are there?you have options to help manage your asthma. your healthcare provider may prescribe medications to control symptoms. these include:bronchodilators: these medicines relax the muscles around your airways. the relaxed muscles let the airways move air. they also let mucus move more easily through the airways. these medicines relieve your symptoms when they happen and are used for intermittent and chronic asthma.anti-inflammatory medicines: these medicines reduce swelling and mucus production in your airways. they make it easier for air to enter and exit your lungs. your healthcare provider may prescribe them to take every day to control or prevent your symptoms of chronic asthma.biologic therapies for asthma: these are used for severe asthma when symptoms persist despite proper inhaler therapy.you can take asthma medicines in several different ways. you may breathe in the medicines using a metered-dose inhaler, nebulizer or another type of asthma inhaler. your healthcare provider may prescribe oral medications that you swallow.what is asthma control?the goal of asthma treatment is to control symptoms. asthma control means you:can do the things you want to do at work and home.have no (or minimal) asthma symptoms.rarely need to use your reliever medicine (rescue inhaler).sleep without asthma interrupting your rest.how do you monitor asthma symptoms?you should keep track of your asthma symptom. it\u2019s an important piece of managing the disease. your healthcare provider may ask to use a peak flow (pf) meter. this device measures how fast you can blow air out of your lungs. it can help your provider make adjustments to your medication. it also tells you if your symptoms are getting worse.care at cleveland clinicasthma treatment

says you have asthma, you\u2019ll need to figure out what triggers an attack. avoiding the triggers can help you avoid an attack. you can\u2019t prevent yourself from getting asthma, though.outlook / prognosiswhat\u2019s the outlook for someone with asthma?if you have asthma, you can still live a very productive life and participate in sports and other activities. your healthcare provider can help you manage symptoms, learn your triggers and prevent or manage attacks.living withwhat is an asthma action plan?your healthcare provider will work with you to develop an asthma action plan. this plan tells you how and when to use your medicines. it also tells you what to do based on your asthma symptoms and when to seek emergency care. ask your healthcare provider about anything you don\u2019t understand.what should i do if i have a severe asthma attack?if you have a severe asthma attack, you need to get immediate medical care.the first thing you should do is use your rescue inhaler. a rescue inhaler uses fast-acting medicines to open up your airways. it\u2019s different than a maintenance inhaler, which you use every day. you should use the rescue inhaler when symptoms are bothering you and you can use it more frequently if your flare is severe.if your rescue inhaler doesn\u2019t help or you don\u2019t have it with you, go to the emergency department if you have:anxiety or panic.bluish fingernails, bluish lips (in light-skinned people) or gray or whitish lips or gums (in dark-skinned people).chest pain or pressure.coughing that won\u2019t stop or severe wheezing when you breathe.difficulty talking.pale, sweaty face.very quick or rapid breathing.additional common questionshow do you know if do or don\u2019t have asthma?you\u2019ll need to see a healthcare provider to find out if you have asthma or some other condition. there are other respiratory diseases that make it hard to breathe or cause coughing and wheezing.can asthma be cured?no. asthma can\u2019t be cured, but it can be managed. children may outgrow asthma as they get older.why is my asthma worse at night?asthma that gets worse at night is sometimes called nighttime asthma or nocturnal asthma. there are no definite reasons that this happens, but there are some educated guesses. these include:the way you sleep: sleeping on your back can result in mucus dripping into your throat or acid reflux coming back up from your stomach. also, sleeping on your back puts pressure on your chest and lungs, which makes breathing more difficult. however, lying face down or on your side can put pressure on your lungs.triggers in your bedroom and triggers that happen in the evening: you may find your blankets, sheets and pillows have dust mites, mold or pet hair on them. if you\u2019ve been outside in the early evening, you may have brought pollen in with you.medication side effects: some drugs that treat asthma, such as steroids and montelukast, can affect your sleep.air that\u2019s too hot or too cold: hot air can cause airways to narrow when you breathe in. cold air is an asthma trigger for some people.lung function changes: lung function lessens at night as a natural process.asthma is poorly controlled during the day: symptoms that aren\u2019t controlled during the day won\u2019t be better at night. it\u2019s important to work with your provider to make sure your asthma symptoms are controlled both day and night. treating nighttime symptoms is very important. serious asthma attacks, and sometimes deaths, can happen at night.what should i know about covid-19 and asthma?if you have asthma that is moderate-to-severe, or if your asthma symptoms aren\u2019t well controlled, you\u2019re at greater risk of having to be hospitalized if you get covid-19. therefore, you should wear a mask if you go to indoor spaces with other people, get vaccinated and avoid exposure to people who have the virus.a note from cleveland clinicmany people live fulfilling lives with asthma. some professional athletes with asthma have set records in their sports. your healthcare provider can help you find the best way to manage your asthma. talk to your healthcare provider about how to control your symptoms.medically reviewedlast reviewed by a cleveland clinic medical professional on 01/19/2022.learn more about our editorial

exits through the drainage system (trabecular meshwork). if that system is blocked or isn't functioning well, the pressure inside the eye (intraocular pressure) builds, which in turn damages the optic nerve. with the most common type of glaucoma, this results in gradual vision loss. glaucoma is a group of eye conditions that damage the optic nerve. the optic nerve sends visual information from your eye to your brain and is vital for good vision. damage to the optic nerve is often related to high pressure in your eye. but glaucoma can happen even with normal eye pressure. glaucoma can occur at any age but is more common in older adults. it is one of the leading causes of blindness for people over the age of 60. many forms of glaucoma have no warning signs. the effect is so gradual that you may not notice a change in vision until the condition is in its later stages. it's important to have regular eye exams that include measurements of your eye pressure. if glaucoma is recognized early, vision loss can be slowed or prevented. if you have glaucoma, you'll need treatment or monitoring for the rest of your life.products & servicesa book: mayo clinic guide to better vision symptomsthe symptoms of glaucoma depend on the type and stage of your condition. open-angle glaucoma no symptoms in early stages gradually, patchy blind spots in your side vision. side vision also is known as

subscription please, try again in a couple of minutes retry causesglaucoma develops when the optic nerve becomes damaged. as this nerve gradually deteriorates, blind spots develop in your vision. for reasons that doctors don't fully understand, this nerve damage is usually related to increased pressure in the eye. elevated eye pressure happens as the result of a buildup of fluid that flows throughout the inside of the eye. this fluid also is known as the aqueous humor. it usually drains through a tissue located at the angle where the iris and cornea meet. this tissue also is called the trabecular meshwork. the cornea is important to vision because it lets light into the eye. when the eye makes too much fluid or the drainage system doesn't work properly, eye pressure may increase. open-angle glaucomathis is the most common form of glaucoma. the drainage angle formed by the iris and cornea remains open. but other parts of the drainage system don't drain properly. this may lead to a slow, gradual increase in eye pressure. angle-closure glaucomathis form of glaucoma occurs when the iris bulges. the bulging iris partially or completely blocks the drainage angle. as a result, fluid can't circulate through the eye and pressure increases. angle-closure glaucoma may occur suddenly or gradually. normal-tension glaucomano one knows the exact reason why the optic nerve becomes damaged when eye pressure is normal. the optic nerve may be sensitive or experience less blood flow. this limited blood flow may be caused by the buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries or other conditions that damage circulation. the buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries also is known as atherosclerosis. glaucoma in childrena child may be born with glaucoma or develop it in the first few years of life. blocked drainage, injury or an underlying medical condition may cause optic nerve damage. pigmentary glaucomain pigmentary glaucoma, small pigment granules flake off from the iris and block or slow fluid drainage from the eye. activities such as jogging sometimes stir up the pigment granules. that leads to a deposit of pigment granules on tissue located at the angle where the iris and cornea meet. the granule deposits cause an increase in pressure. glaucoma tends to run in families. in some people, scientists have identified genes related to high eye pressure and optic nerve damage. risk factorsglaucoma can damage vision before you notice any symptoms. so be aware of these risk factors: high internal eye pressure, also known as intraocular pressure age over 55 black, asian or hispanic heritage family history of glaucoma certain medical conditions, such as diabetes, migraines, high blood pressure and sickle cell anemia corneas that are thin in the center extreme nearsightedness or farsightedness eye injury or certain types of eye surgery taking corticosteroid medicines, especially eye drops, for a long time some people have narrow drainage angles, putting them at increased risk of angle-closure glaucoma. preventionthese steps may help detect and manage glaucoma in its early stages. that may help to prevent vision loss or slow its progress. get regular eye examinations. regular comprehensive eye exams can help detect glaucoma in its early stages, before significant damage occurs. as a general rule, the american academy of ophthalmology recommends a comprehensive eye exam every 5 to 10 years if you're under 40 years old; every 2 to 4 years if you're 40 to 54 years old; every 1 to 3 years if you're 55 to 64 years old; and every 1 to 2 years if you're older than 65. if you're at risk of glaucoma, you'll need more frequent screening. ask your health care provider to recommend the right screening schedule for you. know your family's eye health history. glaucoma tends to run in families. if you're at increased risk, you may need more frequent screening. wear eye protection. serious eye injuries can lead to glaucoma. wear eye protection when using power tools or playing sports. take prescribed eye drops regularly. glaucoma eye drops can significantly reduce the risk that high eye pressure will progress to glaucoma. use eye drops as prescribed by your health care provider even if you have no symptoms. the mayo clinic experience and patient stories our patients tell us that the quality of their interactions, our attention to

damage from fluid buildup in their eye. left untreated, this eye pressure can permanently affect vision. glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness in the world. treatments \u2014 including eyedrops, laser treatments and surgeries \u2014 can slow down vision loss and save your sight.contentsarrow downoverviewsymptoms and causesdiagnosis and testsmanagement and treatmentpreventionoutlook / prognosisliving withcontentsarrow downoverviewsymptoms and causesdiagnosis and testsmanagement and treatmentpreventionoutlook / prognosisliving withoverviewglaucoma is characterized by fluid and pressure in your eye building up and damaging your optic nerve.what is glaucoma?glaucoma is a general term used to describe a group of eye disorders that damage your optic nerve. it\u2019s the most common form of optic nerve damage leading to vision loss.in most cases, fluid builds up in the front part of your eye. this extra fluid puts pressure on your eye, gradually damaging your optic nerve. the name of this pressure is intraocular pressure (iop), or eye pressure. some people have normal eye pressure and still get glaucoma. untreated glaucoma or poorly managed glaucoma can lead to permanent and irreversible vision loss and blindness.most people develop glaucoma in both eyes, although the disease initially may be worse in one eye. with open-angle glaucoma, one eye may have moderate or severe damage, while the other eye may be mildly affected. people with closed-angle glaucoma in one eye have a 40% to 80% chance of developing the same type of glaucoma in the other eye within five to 10 years.how common is glaucoma?glaucoma is a common age-related eye issue that affects an estimated 3 million americans. globally, it\u2019s the second leading cause of blindness after cataracts.what are the types of glaucoma?there are several types of glaucoma, including:open-angle glaucomathis type is the most common, affecting up to 90% of americans who have glaucoma. it occurs when resistance builds up in your eye\u2019s drainage canals. your drainage canals appear to be open and functioning normally. over months or years, the fluid in your eye can build up and put pressure on your optic nerve. the disease may go unnoticed for years because most people don\u2019t have symptoms.closed-angle glaucomaalso called angle-closure or narrow-angle glaucoma, this rare type often comes on suddenly (acute). it occurs when the angle between your iris and cornea is too narrow. it may happen when your pupil changes and becomes too big (dilated) too quickly. this blocks your drainage canals and prevents aqueous fluid from leaving your eye, causing eye pressure to rise. symptoms, including eye pain and headaches, can be severe and require immediate medical attention.normal-tension glaucomaas many as 1 in 3 people have optic nerve damage even when eye pressure is normal or not very high. experts are uncertain about what causes normal-tension glaucoma. another name for this type is normal-pressure or low-tension glaucoma. this type is more common among people of asian descent or asian americans.congenital glaucomasome babies are born with drainage canals that don\u2019t form properly in the womb. your healthcare provider might notice your baby\u2019s glaucoma symptoms at birth or signs may become noticeable during childhood. other names for this type are childhood, infantile or pediatric glaucoma.advertisementcleveland clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. advertising on our site helps support our mission. we do not endorse non-cleveland clinic products or services. policysymptoms and causeswhat are the symptoms of glaucoma?people want to know what the early warning symptoms of glaucoma are. the problem is that for some types of glaucoma, there aren\u2019t any early warning symptoms, and changes to vision can happen gradually, so the symptoms are easy to miss. because many people with open-angle glaucoma don\u2019t have any noticeable symptoms, it\u2019s very important to have routine eye exams to detect this disease in its earlier stages. glaucoma damage is irreversible, so you need early detection and treatment to prevent blindness.closed-angle glaucoma has more severe symptoms that tend to come on suddenly.with any type, you may experience:eye pain or pressure.headaches.rainbow-colored halos around lights.low vision, blurred vision, narrowed vision (tunnel vision) or blind spots.nausea and vomiting.red eyes.what causes glaucoma?glaucoma can occur without any cause, but many factors can affect it. the most important of these factors is intraocular eye pressure. your eyes produce a fluid called aqueous humor that nourishes them. this liquid flows through your pupil to the front of your eye. in a healthy eye, the fluid leaves through the drainage canals located between your iris and cornea.with glaucoma, the resistance increases in your drainage canals. the fluid has nowhere to go, so it builds up in your eye. this excess fluid puts pressure on your eye. eventually, this elevated eye pressure can damage your optic nerve and lead to glaucoma.advertisementwhat are risk factors for glaucoma?glaucoma can affect anyone, but the risk increases with age. people who are black and hispanic are much more likely to get glaucoma than other ethnic groups, and they tend to develop the disease earlier in life. asian and inuit populations are also more susceptible to a specific form of glaucoma known as angle-closure glaucoma or closed-angle glaucoma.people with diabetes are twice as likely to get glaucoma. other risk factors include:family history of glaucoma.farsightedness or hyperopia (for closed-angle glaucoma).high blood pressure (hypertension and very low blood pressure (hypotension)long-term use of corticosteroids.nearsightedness or myopia (for open-angle glaucoma).previous eye injury or surgery.diagnosis and testshow is glaucoma diagnosed?it\u2019s possible to have glaucoma and not know it. regular eye exams are important to catch glaucoma or other eye problems. eye exams can assess optic health and vision loss.to check for glaucoma, an eye doctor may do one or more of these painless tests:dilated eye exam to widen pupils and view your optic nerve at the back of your eyes.gonioscopy to examine the angle where your iris and cornea meet.optical coherence tomography (oct) to look for changes in your optic nerve that may indicate glaucoma.ocular pressure test (tonometry) to measure eye pressure.pachymetry to measure corneal thickness.slit-lamp exam to examine the inside of your eye with a special microscope called a slit lamp.visual acuity test (eye charts) to check for vision loss.visual field test (perimetry) to check for changes in peripheral vision (your ability to see things off to the side).advertisementmanagement and treatmenthow is glaucoma managed or treated?untreated glaucoma can lead to the faster development of permanent vision loss or blindness. treatments can slow down additional vision loss, but they can\u2019t restore lost vision. it\u2019s important to see an eye doctor right away if you have eye pain, severe headaches or vision problems.medications to treat glaucomamany types of prescription eye drops can treat glaucoma. some decrease fluids and increase drainage to improve eye pressure. because glaucoma is a lifelong condition, you may need to use daily eye drops for life. you may have to apply them more than once a day.the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) approved a new delivery device for bimatoprost, a glaucoma treatment that\u2019s been available as eye drops. now, you can get an implant that dissolves and works for several months. your eye care provider places the bimatoprost implant (durysta\u00ae) into your eye. currently, you can only have it placed once in each eye.laser therapy to treat glaucomayour eye doctor uses a laser (a strong beam of light) to help improve fluid drainage from your eye. your provider may suggest lasers as a first-line therapy instead of drops or in addition to eye drops. having laser treatment may not replace the use of eye drops completely. the results from laser treatments vary but can last for years in some cases. your provider may be able to repeat some types of laser treatments.surgery to treat glaucomasurgery is another way to help reduce eye pressure. it\u2019s more invasive but can also achieve better eye pressure control faster than drops or lasers. surgery can help slow down vision loss, but it can\u2019t restore lost vision or cure glaucoma. there are many types of surgeries for glaucoma, and depending on the specific type and severity, your eye doctor may choose one over another.for instance, there\u2019s traditional surgery that involves cutting your eye and minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (called migs). there are many types of migs procedures available, including different types of stents or devices used to improve the outflow of fluid from your eye. the migs procedures typically take less time to perform and have a faster recovery time with potentially fewer risks than traditional glaucoma surgeries. the types of surgeries available for glaucoma, especially the less invasive migs procedures, continue to expand and evolve.what are the complications of glaucoma?an estimated 1 in 10 people with glaucoma develop some degree of visual impairment. blindness is less common and affects 5% of people with glaucoma.can glaucoma be cured?no, there\u2019s no cure for glaucoma. however, you can manage symptoms and stop the disease from getting worse.what is the most effective treatment for glaucoma?there isn\u2019t one best treatment for glaucoma. your provider may suggest one treatment for you and a different one for someone else who has glaucoma.care at cleveland clinicglaucoma treatmentfind a doctor and specialistsmake an appointmentpreventionhow can i prevent glaucoma?early detection of glaucoma through routine eye exams is the best way to protect eye health and prevent vision loss. glaucoma testing should occur every:one to three years after age 35 for people at high risk.two to four years before age 40.one to three years between ages 40 and 54.one to two years between ages 55 to 64.six months to 12 months after age 65.outlook / prognosiswhat can i expect if i have glaucoma?blindness is a rare complication for people with glaucoma, as long as a provider detects it early. however, glaucoma is a chronic and progressive condition that often causes some degree of vision loss over time. the earlier you catch glaucoma and start treatments, the better the odds of saving your vision. treatments can slow down disease progression and vision loss. if you\u2019re at high risk for glaucoma, you should get regular eye exams.living withwhen should i call the doctor?you should call your healthcare provider if you experience:blurred or low vision.halos, eye floaters or flashers.sudden, severe eye pain or headaches.sensitivity to light.vision loss.what questions should i ask my doctor?you may want to ask your healthcare provider:why did i get glaucoma?what type of glaucoma do i have?what\u2019s the best treatment for the type of glaucoma i have?are there any treatment risks or side effects?what lifestyle changes can i make to protect my vision?should i watch for signs of complications?a note from cleveland clinicwhile there isn\u2019t a cure for glaucoma, treatments can keep eye pressure under control and prevent vision loss. eye exams can catch the disease early and save your sight. if you\u2019re at high risk for glaucoma, ask your eye doctor how often you need screenings. if you have glaucoma, it\u2019s important to use daily eye drops as prescribed. you can also ask your provider about laser treatments and surgery options. with proper care, you can keep glaucoma from worsening and causing irreversible vision loss or blindness.medically reviewedlast reviewed by a cleveland clinic medical professional on 11/18/2022.learn more about our editorial process.referencesadvertisementcleveland clinic is a non-profit

glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that can cause vision loss and blindness by damaging a nerve in the back of your eye called the optic nerve. the symptoms can start so slowly that you may not notice them. the only way to find out if you have glaucoma is to get a comprehensive dilated eye exam. there\u2019s no cure for glaucoma, but early treatment can often stop the damage and protect your vision. what are the types of glaucoma? there are many different types of glaucoma, but the most common type in the united states is called open-angle glaucoma \u2014 that\u2019s what most people mean when they talk about glaucoma. other types are less common, like angle-closure glaucoma and congenital glaucoma. learn more about the types of glaucoma what are the symptoms of glaucoma? at first, glaucoma doesn\u2019t usually have any symptoms. that\u2019s why half of people with glaucoma don\u2019t even know they have it. over time, you may slowly lose vision, usually starting with your side (peripheral) vision \u2014 especially the part of your vision that\u2019s closest to your nose. because it happens so slowly, many people can\u2019t tell that their vision is changing at first. but as the disease gets worse, you may start to notice that you can\u2019t see things off to the side anymore. without treatment, glaucoma can eventually cause blindness. am i at risk for glaucoma? anyone can get glaucoma, but some people are at higher risk. you\u2019re at higher risk if you: are over age 60, especially if you\u2019re hispanic/latino are african american and over age 40 have a family history of glaucoma talk with your doctor about your risk for glaucoma, and ask how often you need to get checked. if you\u2019re at higher risk, you need to get a comprehensive dilated eye exam every 1 to 2 years. when to get help right away angle-closure glaucoma can cause these sudden symptoms: intense eye pain upset stomach (nausea) red eye blurry vision if you have any of these symptoms, go to your doctor or an emergency room now. what causes glaucoma? scientists aren\u2019t sure what causes the most common types of glaucoma, but many people with glaucoma have high eye pressure \u2014 and treatments that lower eye pressure help to slow the disease. learn more about eye pressure and glaucoma there\u2019s no way to prevent glaucoma. that\u2019s why eye exams are so important \u2014 so you and your doctor can find it before it affects your vision. how will my eye doctor check for glaucoma? eye doctors can check for glaucoma as part of a comprehensive dilated eye exam. the exam is simple and painless \u2014 your doctor will give you some eye drops to dilate (widen) your pupil and then check your eyes for glaucoma and other eye problems. the exam includes a visual field test to check your side vision. learn what to expect from a dilated eye exam did you know? glaucoma can happen in 1 eye or both eyes some people with high eye pressure don\u2019t get glaucoma \u2014 and there\u2019s a type of glaucoma that happens in people with normal eye pressure normal eye pressure varies by person \u2014 what\u2019s normal for 1 person could be high for another what\u2019s the treatment for glaucoma? doctors use different types of treatment for glaucoma, including medicines (usually eye drops), laser treatment, and surgery. if you have glaucoma, it\u2019s important to start treatment right away. treatment won\u2019t undo any damage to your vision, but it can stop it from getting worse. medicines. prescription eye drops are the most common treatment. they lower the pressure in your eye and prevent damage to your optic nerve. learn more about glaucoma medicines laser treatment. to lower your eye pressure, doctors can use lasers to help the fluid drain out of your eye. it\u2019s a simple procedure that your doctor can do in the office. learn more about laser treatment for glaucoma surgery. if medicines and laser treatment don\u2019t work, your doctor might suggest surgery. there are several different types of surgery that can help the fluid drain out of your eye. learn more about glaucoma surgery talk over your options with your doctor. while glaucoma is a serious disease, treatment works well. remember these tips: if your doctor prescribes medicine, be sure to take it every day tell your doctor if your treatment causes side effects see your doctor for regular check-ups if you\u2019re having trouble with everyday activities because of your vision loss, ask your doctor about vision rehabilitation services or devices that could help encourage family members to get checked for glaucoma, since it can run in families featured resource: talk with your doctor about glaucoma do you have glaucoma?

disease that damages your eye\u2019s optic nerve. it usually happens when fluid builds up in the front part of your eye. that extra fluid increases the pressure in your eye, damaging the optic nerve. in this article: video: what is glaucoma? what causes glaucoma? types of glaucoma video: what is angle-closure glaucoma? what are common glaucoma symptoms? who is at risk for glaucoma? glaucoma diagnosis glaucoma treatment video: what is glaucoma? glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness for people over 60 years old. but blindness from glaucoma can often be prevented with early treatment. in a healthy eye, fluid leaves the eye through the drainage angle, keeping pressure stable. what is the main cause of glaucoma? your eye constantly makes aqueous humor. as new aqueous flows into your eye, the same amount should drain out. the fluid drains out through an area called the drainage angle. this process keeps pressure in the eye (called intraocular pressure or iop) stable. but if the drainage angle is not working properly, fluid builds up. pressure inside the eye rises, damaging the optic nerve. if the drainage angle is blocked, fluid cannot flow out of the eye, causing pressure to increase. the optic nerve is made of more than a million tiny nerve fibers. it is like an electric cable made up of many small wires. as these nerve fibers die, you will develop blind spots in your vision. you may not notice these blind spots until most of your optic nerve fibers have died. if all of the fibers die, you will become blind. how do you get glaucoma? there are two major types of glaucoma. open-angle glaucoma this is the most common type of glaucoma. it happens gradually, where the eye does not drain fluid as well as it should (like a clogged drain). as a result, eye pressure builds and starts to damage the optic nerve. this type of glaucoma is painless and causes no vision changes at first. some people can have optic nerves that are sensitive to normal eye pressure. this means their risk of getting glaucoma is higher than normal. regular eye exams are important to find early signs of damage to their optic nerve. angle-closure glaucoma (also called \u201cclosed-angle glaucoma\u201d or \u201cnarrow-angle glaucoma\u201d) this type happens when someone\u2019s iris is very close to the drainage angle in their eye. the iris can end up blocking the drainage angle. you can think of it like a piece of paper sliding over a sink drain. when the drainage angle gets completely blocked, eye pressure rises very quickly. this is called an acute attack. it is a true eye emergency, and you should call your ophthalmologist right away or you might go blind. here are the signs of an acute angle-closure glaucoma attack: your vision is suddenly blurry you have severe eye pain you have a headache you feel sick to your stomach (nausea) you throw up (vomit) you see rainbow-colored rings or halos around lights many people with angle-closure glaucoma develop it slowly. this is called chronic angle-closure glaucoma. there are no symptoms at first, so they don\u2019t know they have it until the damage is severe or they have an attack. angle-closure glaucoma can cause blindness if not treated right away. video: what is angle-closure glaucoma? what happens if you have glaucoma? open-angle glaucoma symptoms with open-angle glaucoma, there are no warning signs or obvious symptoms in the early stages. as the disease progresses, blind spots develop in your peripheral (side) vision. most people with open-angle glaucoma do not notice any change in their vision until the damage is quite severe. this is why glaucoma is called the \u201csilent thief of sight.\u201d having regular eye exams can help your ophthalmologist find this disease before you lose vision. your ophthalmologist can tell you how often you should be examined. angle-closure glaucoma symptoms people at risk for angle-closure glaucoma usually show no symptoms before an attack. some early symptoms of an attack may include blurred vision, halos, mild headaches or eye pain. people with these symptoms should be checked by their ophthalmologist as soon as possible. an attack of angle-closure glaucoma includes the following: severe pain in the eye or forehead redness of the eye decreased vision or blurred vision seeing rainbows or halos headache nausea vomiting normal tension glaucoma symptoms people with \"normal tension glaucoma\" have eye pressure that is within normal ranges, but show signs of glaucoma, such as blind spots in their field of vision and optic nerve damage. do glaucoma suspects have symptoms? some people have no signs of damage but have higher than normal eye pressure (called ocular hypertension). these patients are considered \"glaucoma suspects\" and have a higher risk of eventually developing glaucoma. some people are considered glaucoma suspects even if their eye pressure is normal. for example, their ophthalmologist may notice something different about their optic nerve. most glaucoma suspects have no symptoms. that is why you need to be carefully monitored by your ophthalmologist if you are a glaucoma suspect. an ophthalmologist can check for any changes over time and begin treatment if needed. pigment dispersion syndrome and pigmentary glaucoma symptoms pigment dispersion syndrome (pds) happens when the pigment rubs off the back of your iris. this pigment can raise eye pressure andlead to pigmentary glaucoma. some people with pds or pigmentary glaucoma may see halos or have blurry vision after activities like jogging or playing basketball see your ophthalmologist if you have these or other symptoms. who is at risk for glaucoma? some people have a higher than normal risk of getting glaucoma. this includes people who: are over age 40 have family members with glaucoma are of african, hispanic, or asian heritage have high eye pressure are farsighted or nearsighted have had an eye injury use long-term steroid medications have corneas that are thin in the center have thinning of the optic nerve have diabetes, migraines, high blood pressure, poor blood circulation or other health problems affecting the whole body talk with an ophthalmologist about your risk for getting glaucoma. people with more than one of these risk factors have an even higher risk of glaucoma. glaucoma diagnosis the only sure way to diagnose glaucoma is with a complete eye exam. a glaucoma screening that only checks eye pressure is not enough to find glaucoma. during a glaucoma exam, your ophthalmologist will: measure your eye pressure inspect your eye's drainage angle examine your optic nerve for damage test your peripheral (side) vision take a picture or computer measurement of your optic nerve measure the thickness of your cornea glaucoma is a silent thief of sight glaucoma has no symptoms in its early stages. in fact, half the people with glaucoma do not know they have it! having regular eye exams can help your ophthalmologist find this disease before you lose vision. your ophthalmologist can tell you how often you should be examined. can glaucoma be stopped? glaucoma damage is permanent\u2014it cannot be reversed. but medicine and surgery help to stop further damage. to treat glaucoma, your ophthalmologist may use one or more of the following treatments. video: how to insert eyedrops medication glaucoma is usually controlled with eyedrop medicine. used every day, these eye drops lower eye pressure. some do this by reducing the amount of aqueous fluid the eye makes. others reduce pressure by helping fluid flow better through the drainage angle. glaucoma medications can help you keep your vision, but they may also produce side effects. some eye drops may cause: a stinging or itching sensation red eyes or red skin around the eyes changes in your pulse and heartbeat changes in your energy level changes in breathing (especially if you have asthma or breathing problems) dry mouth blurred vision eyelash growth changes in your eye color, the skin around your eyes or eyelid appearance all medications can have side effects. some drugs can cause problems when taken with other medications. it is important to give your doctor a list of every medicine you take regularly. be sure to talk with your ophthalmologist if you think you may have side effects from glaucoma medicine. never change or stop taking your glaucoma medications without talking to your ophthalmologist. if you are about to run out of your medication, ask your ophthalmologist if you should have your prescription refilled. laser surgery there are two main types of laser surgery to treat glaucoma. they help aqueous drain from the eye. these procedures are usually done in the ophthalmologist\u2019s office or an outpatient surgery center. trabeculoplasty. this surgery is for people who have open-angle glaucoma and can be used instead of or in addition to medications. the eye surgeon uses a laser to make the drainage angle work better. that way fluid flows out properly and eye pressure is reduced. iridotomy. this is for people who have angle-closure glaucoma. the ophthalmologist uses a laser to create a tiny hole in the iris. this hole helps fluid flow to the drainage angle. video: what happens during laser iridotomy surgery? operating room surgery some glaucoma surgery is done in an operating room. it creates a new drainage channel for the aqueous humor to leave the eye. trabeculectomy. this is where your eye surgeon creates a tiny flap in the sclera. they will also create a bubble (like a pocket) in the conjunctiva called a filtration bleb. it is usually hidden under the upper eyelid and cannot be seen. aqueous humor will be able to drain out of the eye through the flap and into the bleb, lowering eye pressure. in the bleb, the fluid is absorbed by tissue around your eye. in trabeculectomy, a flap is first created in the sclera (the white part of the eye). then a small opening is made into the eye to release fluid from the eye. glaucoma drainage devices. your ophthalmologist may implant a tiny drainage tube in your eye. the glaucoma drainage implant sends the fluid to a collection area (called a reservoir). your eye surgeon creates this reservoir beneath the conjunctiva. the fluid is then absorbed into nearby blood vessels. cataract surgery. for some people with narrow angles, removing the eye's natural lens can lower eye pressure. with narrow angles, the iris and the cornea are too close together. this can cover (block) the eye\u2019s drainage channel. removing the eye's lens with cataract surgery creates more space for fluid to leave the eye. this can lower eye pressure. your role in glaucoma treatment treating glaucoma successfully is a team effort between you and your doctor. your ophthalmologist will prescribe your glaucoma treatment. it is up to you to follow your doctor\u2019s instructions and use your eye drops. once you are taking medications for glaucoma, your ophthalmologist will want to see you regularly. you can expect to visit your ophthalmologist about every 3\u20136 months. however, this can vary depending on your treatment needs. if you have any questions about your eyes or your treatment, talk to your ophthalmologist. nextglaucoma eye drops more glaucoma articles does

leukemia are more common in children. other forms of leukemia occur mostly in adults. leukemia usually involves the white blood cells. your white blood cells are potent infection fighters \u2014 they normally grow and divide in an orderly way, as your body needs them. but in people with leukemia, the bone marrow produces an excessive amount of abnormal white blood cells, which don't function properly. treatment for leukemia can be complex \u2014 depending on the type of leukemia and other factors. but there are strategies and resources that can help make your treatment successful.products

against infection and disease. the lymphatic system includes the spleen, thymus, lymph nodes and lymph channels, as well as the tonsils and adenoids. scientists don't understand the exact causes of leukemia. it seems to develop from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. how leukemia formsin general, leukemia is thought to occur when some blood cells acquire changes (mutations) in their genetic material or dna. a cell's dna contains the instructions that tell a cell what to do. normally, the dna tells the cell to grow at a set rate and to die at a set time. in leukemia, the mutations tell the blood cells to continue growing and dividing. when this happens, blood cell production becomes out of control. over time, these abnormal cells can crowd out healthy blood cells in the bone marrow, leading to fewer healthy white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets, causing the signs and symptoms of leukemia. how leukemia is classifieddoctors classify leukemia based on its speed of progression and the type of cells involved. the first type of classification is by how fast the leukemia progresses: acute leukemia. in acute leukemia, the abnormal blood cells are immature blood cells (blasts). they can't carry out their normal functions, and they multiply rapidly, so the disease worsens quickly. acute leukemia requires aggressive, timely treatment. chronic leukemia. there are many types of chronic leukemias. some produce too many cells and some cause too few cells to be produced. chronic leukemia involves more-mature blood cells. these blood cells replicate or accumulate more slowly and can function normally for a period of time. some forms of chronic leukemia initially produce no early symptoms and can go unnoticed or undiagnosed for years. the second type of classification is by type of white blood cell affected: lymphocytic leukemia. this type of leukemia affects the lymphoid cells (lymphocytes), which form lymphoid or lymphatic tissue. lymphatic tissue makes up your immune system. myelogenous (my-uh-lohj-uh-nus) leukemia. this type of leukemia affects the myeloid cells. myeloid cells give rise to red blood cells, white blood cells and platelet-producing cells. types of leukemiathe major types of leukemia are: acute lymphocytic leukemia (all). this is the most common type of leukemia in young children. all can also occur in adults. acute myelogenous leukemia (aml). aml is a common type of leukemia. it occurs in children and adults. aml is the most common type of acute leukemia in adults. chronic lymphocytic leukemia (cll). with cll, the most common chronic adult leukemia, you may feel well for years without needing treatment. chronic myelogenous leukemia (cml). this type of leukemia mainly affects adults. a person with cml may have few or no symptoms for months or years before entering a phase in which the leukemia cells grow more quickly. other types. other, rarer types of leukemia exist, including hairy cell leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes and myeloproliferative disorders. risk factorsfactors that may increase your risk of developing some types of leukemia include: previous cancer treatment. people who've had certain types of chemotherapy and radiation therapy for other cancers have an increased risk of developing certain types of leukemia. genetic disorders. genetic abnormalities seem to play a role in the development of leukemia. certain genetic disorders, such as down syndrome, are associated with an increased risk of leukemia. exposure to certain chemicals. exposure to certain chemicals, such as benzene \u2014 which is found in gasoline and is used by the chemical industry \u2014 is linked to an increased risk of some kinds of leukemia. smoking. smoking cigarettes increases the risk of acute myelogenous leukemia. family history of leukemia. if members of your family have been diagnosed with leukemia, your risk of the disease may be increased. however, most people with known risk factors don't get leukemia. and many people with leukemia have none of these risk factors. by mayo clinic staff leukemia care at mayo clinic request an appointment diagnosis & treatment sept. 21, 2022 print

common questionsoverviewnormal blood contains red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. leukemia cells outnumber the normally seen healthy blood cells.what is leukemia?leukemia is a cancer of the blood, characterized by the rapid growth of abnormal blood cells. this uncontrolled growth takes place in your bone marrow, where most of your body\u2019s blood is made. leukemia cells are usually immature (still developing) white blood cells. the term leukemia comes from the greek words for \u201cwhite\u201d (leukos) and \u201cblood\u201d (haima).unlike other cancers, leukemia doesn\u2019t generally form a mass (tumor) that shows up in imaging tests, such as x-rays or ct scans.there are many types of leukemia. some are more common in children, while others are more common in adults. treatment depends on the type of leukemia and other factors.advertisementcleveland clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. advertising on our site helps support our mission. we do not endorse non-cleveland clinic products or services. policyhow does leukemia develop?leukemia begins in bone marrow, the soft spongy tissue in the inner cavity of your bones, where your body\u2019s blood cells are made. blood cells go through multiple stages before reaching their fully mature forms. mature, normal blood cells include:red blood cells: cells that carry oxygen and other vital materials to all tissues and organs in your body.white blood cells: cells that fight infection.platelets: cells that help your blood clot.these blood cells start as hematopoietic (hemo = blood, poiesis = make) stem cells. the stem cells develop into either myeloid (mai-uh-loyd) cells or lymphoid (lim-foyd) cells. if blood cells were to continue to develop normally, the mature forms of these cells are as follows:myeloid cells develop into red blood cells, platelets and certain types of white blood cells (basophils, eosinophils and neutrophils).lymphoid cells develop into certain white blood cells (lymphocytes and natural killer cells).however, if you have leukemia, one of the developing blood cells begins to multiply out of control. these abnormal cells \u2014 called leukemia cells \u2014 begin to take over the space inside of your bone marrow. they crowd out the cells trying to develop into healthy red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets.how does leukemia affect my body?having too many leukemia cells and too few normal cells is harmful for several reasons:leukemia cells serve no purpose in keeping you healthy.normal blood cells have very little space and support to mature and multiply inside of your bone marrow because the leukemia cells overtake them.fewer red blood cells, healthy white blood cells and platelets are made and released into your blood. as a result, your body\u2019s organs and tissues won\u2019t get the oxygen needed to work properly. also, your body won\u2019t be able to fight infections or form blood clots when needed.advertisementwhat are the different types of leukemia?there are four main types of leukemia and several subtypes. healthcare providers classify leukemia based on how fast the disease worsens and whether leukemia cells arise from myeloid cells or lymphoid cells.classifications of leukemiahealthcare providers classify leukemia based on how quickly it progresses and the type of blood cell involved.by speed of disease progressionacute leukemia. the leukemia cells divide rapidly and the disease progresses quickly. if you have acute leukemia, you\u2019ll feel sick within weeks of the leukemia cells forming. acute leukemia is life-threatening and requires immediate initiation of therapy. acute leukemia is the most common cancer in children.chronic leukemia. often, these leukemia cells behave as both immature and mature blood cells. some cells develop to the point where they function as the cells they were meant to become \u2014 but not to the extent their normal counterparts do. the disease typically worsens slowly compared to acute leukemia. if you have chronic leukemia, you may not have noticeable symptoms for years. chronic leukemia is more common in adults than in children.by cell typemyelogenous (mai-uh-low-juh-nuhs) or myeloid leukemia develops from myeloid cells. normal myeloid cells develop into red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets.lymphocytic leukemia develops from lymphoid cells. normal lymphoid cells develop into white blood cells that are an important part of your body\u2019s immune system.types of leukemiathere are four main types of leukemia:acute lymphocytic leukemia (all) is the most common type of leukemia in children, teens and young adults up to age 39. all can affect adults of any age.acute myelogenous leukemia (aml)is the most common type of acute leukemia in adults. it\u2019s more common in older adults (those over 65). aml also occurs in children.chronic lymphocytic leukemia (cll) is the most common chronic leukemia in adults (most common in people over 65). symptoms may not appear for several years with cll.chronic myelogenous leukemia (cml) is more common in older adults (most common in people over 65) but can affect adults of any age. it rarely occurs in children. symptoms may not appear for several years with cml.how common is leukemia?leukemia is the 10th most common cancer in the u.s., accounting for 3.2% of all new cancer cases. leukemia can affect anyone, but it\u2019s more common among people who are:ages 65 to 74.assigned male at birth (amab).caucasian/white.many people think of leukemia as a pediatric cancer, but some forms develop more often in adults. although leukemia is rare in children, it\u2019s the most common form of cancer affecting children and teens.advertisementsymptoms and causeswhat are the symptoms of leukemia?symptoms depend, in part, on the type of leukemia. for instance, if you have a chronic form of leukemia, you may not have noticeable symptoms in the early stages.common signs and symptoms of leukemia include:fatigue, tiring easily.fever or night sweats.frequent infections.shortness of breath.pale skin.unexplained weight loss.bone/joint pain or tenderness.pain or full feeling under your ribs on the left side.swollen lymph nodes in your neck, underarm, groin or stomach, an enlarged spleen or liver.bruising and bleeding easily, including nosebleeds, bleeding gums, a rash that looks like tiny red spots in skin (petechiae) or purplish/darkened skin patches.what causes leukemia?leukemia starts when the dna of a single cell in your bone marrow changes (mutates). dna is the \u201cinstruction code\u201d that tells a cell when to grow, how to develop and when to die. because of the mutation, or coding error, leukemia cells keep multiplying. all cells arising from the original mutated cell also have the mutated dna.scientists don\u2019t know what causes these developing cells to mutate. they\u2019ve been able to identify some common mutations that people diagnosed with different types of leukemia share.are certain people at a higher risk for developing leukemia?anyone can develop leukemia. still, studies have shown that certain factors may increase your risk, including:previous cancer treatment. past cancer treatments involving radiation or chemotherapy may increase the likelihood you\u2019ll develop some types of leukemia.smoking. if you have a history of smoking or exposure to second-hand smoke, you\u2019re at increased risk of developing acute myelogenous leukemia.exposure to industrial chemicals. benzene and formaldehyde are known cancer-causing chemicals found in building materials and household chemicals. benzene is used to make plastics, rubbers, dyes, pesticides, drugs and detergents. formaldehyde is in building materials and household products such as soaps, shampoos and cleaning products.certain genetic disorders. genetic disorders, such as neurofibromatosis, klinefelter syndrome, schwachman-diamond syndrome and down syndrome, may increase your risk.family history of leukemia. research suggests that some types of leukemia may run in families. in most cases, however, having a relative with leukemia doesn\u2019t mean that you or another family member will also develop leukemia. tell your healthcare provider if you or a family member has a genetic condition. they may recommend genetic testing to assess your risk.diagnosis and testshow is leukemia diagnosed?results from routine blood work can alert your healthcare provider that you may have an acute or chronic form of leukemia that requires further testing. or they may recommend a workup if you have leukemia symptoms.diagnostic exams and tests may include:physical exam: your healthcare provider will ask about your symptoms and feel for swollen lymph nodes and an enlarged spleen or liver. they may also inspect your gums for bleeding and swelling. they may look for a skin rash associated with leukemia that may appear red, purple or brown.complete blood count (cbc): this blood test lets your healthcare provider know if you have abnormal levels of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. if you have leukemia, you\u2019ll likely have higher than normal counts of white blood cells.blood cell examination: your healthcare provider may take additional blood samples to check for markers that indicate the presence of leukemia cells or a specific type of leukemia. flow cytometry and peripheral blood smear are additional tests your healthcare provider may order.bone marrow biopsy (bone marrow aspiration): your healthcare provider may perform a biopsy if you have an abnormal white blood cell count. a long needle inserted into your bone marrow (usually in your pelvic bone) draws out fluid during the procedure. the fluid sample gets tested in a lab for leukemia cells. a bone marrow biopsy helps determine the percentage of abnormal cells in your bone marrow, confirming a leukemia diagnosis.imaging and other tests: your doctor may order a chest x-ray, ct scan, or magnetic resonance imaging (mri) scan if symptoms indicate leukemia has affected your bones, organs or tissue. the leukemia cells don\u2019t show up on imaging.lumbar puncture (spinal tap): your healthcare provider may test a sample of spinal fluid to see if leukemia has spread to the spinal fluid surrounding your brain and spinal cord.management and treatmenthow is leukemia treated?treatments for leukemia depend on the type of leukemia you have, your age and overall health, and if the leukemia has spread to other organs or tissues.common treatments often include a combination of the following:chemotherapy: chemotherapy is the most common form of leukemia treatment. it involves using chemicals to kill leukemia cells or keep them from multiplying. during treatment, you may receive the chemicals (medication) as a pill, an injection into a vein or a shot under your skin. usually, you\u2019ll receive a combination of chemotherapy drugs.immunotherapy (biologic therapy): this treatment uses certain drugs to boost your body\u2019s defense system \u2014 your immune system \u2014 to fight leukemia. immunotherapy helps your immune system identify cancer cells and produce more immune cells to fight them.targeted therapy: this treatment uses drugs designed to attack specific parts of a leukemia cell (like a protein or gene) that are causing them to overtake normal blood cells. targeted therapies may prevent leukemia cells from multiplying, cut off the cells\u2019 blood supply or kill them directly. targeted therapy is less likely to harm normal cells. examples of targeted therapy drugs include monoclonal antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors.radiation therapy: this treatment uses strong energy beams or x-rays to kill leukemia cells or stop them from growing. during treatment, a machine directs radiation to the exact spots in your body where the cancer cells are or distributes radiation over your whole body. distributing radiation throughout your body may happen before a hematopoietic cell transplant.hematopoietic cell transplant (stem cell or bone marrow transplant): this treatment replaces the cancerous blood-forming cells killed by chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy with new, healthy hematopoietic cells. your healthcare provider may remove these healthy cells from your blood or bone marrow before chemo and radiation, or they may come from a donor. the healthy new cells multiply, forming new bone marrow and blood cells that become the red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets your body needs.chimeric antigen receptor (car) t-cell therapy: this is a novel type of therapy that takes your body\u2019s infection-fighting t-cells (t-cell or t-lymphocyte is a type of immune cell), engineers them to fight leukemia cells and infuse them back into your body.clinical trials are also available to test new cancer treatments. weigh the potential benefits and risks of enrolling in a clinical trial with your healthcare provider.what are the phases of leukemia treatment?depending on your treatment plan, you may receive ongoing leukemia treatments long-term or treatment in phases. generally, phased treatment involves three parts. each phase has a specific goal.induction therapy. the goal is to kill as many leukemia cells as possible in your blood and bone marrow to achieve remission. in remission, blood cell counts return to normal levels, no leukemia cells are found in your blood, and all signs and symptoms of the disease disappear. induction therapy usually lasts four to six weeks.consolidation (also called intensification). the goal is to kill any remaining undetected leukemia cells, so the cancer doesn\u2019t return. you\u2019ll usually receive consolidation therapy in cycles, over four to six months.maintenance therapy. the goal is to kill any leukemia cells that may have survived the first two treatment phases and prevent the cancer from returning (relapse). treatment lasts about two years.your healthcare provider may resume or change your treatment if the leukemia returns.care at cleveland clinicleukemia treatmentfind a doctor and specialistsmake an appointmentoutlook / prognosiswhat outcome can i expect if i have a leukemia diagnosis?it\u2019s difficult to predict the prognosis for leukemia because everyone\u2019s experience is different. outcomes depend on a variety of factors, including:genetic abnormalities or mutations. the mutations inside leukemia cells are the most important predictor of outcome.type of leukemia. certain types of leukemia are associated with more favorable outcomes than others.blood cell counts at the time of diagnosis. the number of leukemia cells at your diagnosis can play a role in your outcome.age. generally, the younger you are at your diagnosis, the better your outcome.health. generally, the healthier you are at your diagnosis, the better your outcome.response to treatment. the length of time it takes for cancer to go into remission often indicates how successful treatment may be.presence of leukemia cells in your central nervous system. cells in your spinal fluid are often more difficult to treat.ultimately, your healthcare provider is the most reliable resource for understanding how your cancer affects your unique prognosis. ask them about treatment outcomes.what is the survival rate of leukemia?although the number of new cases of leukemia in the u.s. has remained relatively steady or slightly increased since the 1970s, the survival rate has also improved. still, long-term outcomes vary for each person.the national cancer institute reports the following survival data for the four main types of leukemia:types of leukemiaallamlcllcml5- year

statistics review, 1975-2017, national cancer institute. bethesda, md.can leukemia be cured?there isn\u2019t a cure for leukemia, but this doesn\u2019t mean some people don\u2019t achieve long-term remission. being cured of leukemia means that the cancer\u2019s gone, it\u2019s not coming back and no more treatment is needed \u2014 but this is hard to know for sure with leukemia.on the other hand, long-term remission means there\u2019s no sign of cancer with or without treatment. remission may last anywhere from a few weeks to many years. the leukemia may never return. if it does, your healthcare provider may recommend new treatments to achieve remission.your healthcare team can best answer the question, \u201cam i cured of my leukemia?\u201d your team will work closely with you to monitor your health and develop a personalized treatment plan.living withwhat questions should i ask my provider?empower yourself by learning all you can about how your cancer diagnosis may uniquely impact you. it\u2019s a good idea to take notes and bring a friend to your appointments. don\u2019t be afraid to ask questions.questions may include:what type of leukemia do i have? in what type of cell? is it a fast- or slow-growing kind of cancer?how early was the leukemia discovered?what are my treatment options?what are the benefits and risks of each type of treatment?what treatment plan is best suited for me? why?when should treatment begin?how long will treatment (and each stage of treatment) last?how long will i be in the hospital?what are the side effects of treatment? what can be done to prevent or lessen these side effects?what if i want to have children? what are my options for preserving my fertility?what\u2019s the success rate/survival rate for my type of leukemia?should i enroll in a clinical trial?additional common questionswhere can i find clinical trials for leukemia?to learn more about clinical trials for leukemia, visit:leukemia & lymphoma society clinical trial

chapter.a note from cleveland clinicany cancer diagnosis is scary, but a leukemia diagnosis may feel especially so. it can be difficult to imagine what the treatment experience will be like without a tumor that can be removed. it can be intimidating to imagine the prognosis. remember that leukemia isn\u2019t one thing with one outcome. your treatment and your chance of long-term remission depend on many factors. no one can predict your outcomes without understanding your health and leukemia \u2014 down to the characteristics of the leukemia cells. talk with your healthcare provider about what

trials & research leukemia doctors & experts leukemia symptoms & signs english english espa\u00f1ol share english english espa\u00f1ol share in both acute and chronic leukemias, as the number of leukemic cells increases, normal cells are crowded out of the bone marrow and symptoms may begin to develop. the symptoms of acute leukemia generally appear suddenly and can also be similar to those of a virus or flu. symptoms can be severe enough that they prompt patients to see a doctor soon after their onset. when chronic leukemia first develops, symptoms may not arise for several years. cll and cml are often discovered as an incidental finding of an elevated white blood cell count during the routine blood tests that are part of a regular checkup. with the passage of time, however, as the number of diseased cells increases they may infiltrate the bone marrow and/or other organs to the point that they cause significant problems. the signs and symptoms that may develop from acute or chronic leukemias most commonly include: anemia bruising and bleeding, resulting from low levels of platelets, the blood component crucial to blood clotting and wound healing infections caused by low levels of disease-fighting white blood cells fevers, drenching night sweats, unintentional weight loss, and fatigue leukemic cells may also invade the liver, spleen, lymph nodes, and other organs, particularly in cll and all, causing discomfort and/or compromise of normal organ function. these symptoms can also be caused by other conditions and do not necessarily mean that you have leukemia. speak with your doctor if you have any of these symptoms to ensure proper diagnosis and treatment. new patient appointments call 646-497-9154 available monday through friday, 8:00 a.m. - 6:00 p.m.

video what is crohn's disease? a mayo clinic expert explains {music playing} william a. faubion, jr., m.d., gastroenterology, mayo clinic: i'm dr. bill faubion, a gastroenterologist at mayo clinic. in this video, we'll cover the basics of crohn's disease. what it is? who gets it? the symptoms, diagnosis and treatment. whether you're looking for answers for yourself or someone you love, we're here to give you the best information available. crohn's disease is an inflammatory bowel disease that causes chronic inflammation of the gi tract, which extends from your stomach all the way down to your anus. different areas of the gi tract can be affected in different people, and it often spreads into the deeper layers of the bowel. it's estimated that over half a million americans are living with crohn's disease. it can be painful and debilitating, occasionally leading to severe complications, as well as emotionally stressful. and while there is no cure, once you've been diagnosed, treatment can help you get back to a more normal and comfortable life. who gets it? there are a lot of particulars that figure into or aggravate crohn's disease, but the exact cause is still unknown. it may involve an abnormal immune response against some microorganism in which your tissues are also attacked. genetics might also play a role. and it's true that you're at higher risk if a first-degree relative has it. but that's really only seen in about 20% of cases. there is a correlation with age. although it can show up at any stage of life, most people are diagnosed before 30. ethnicity is a risk factor. whites have the highest risk, especially among people of ashkenazi jewish descent. however, incidence is increasing among black people in north america and the uk. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications or nsaids... they don't cause crohn's disease, but they are known to trigger inflammation of the bowel and make it worse. they include common over-the-counter painkillers like ibuprofen, naproxen sodium, diclofenac sodium, and others. so if you've been diagnosed with crohn's, make sure you talk to your doctor about what medications should be avoided. many of these elements are out of our hands, but smoking is the most important controllable risk factor for developing crohn's disease. it also leads to more severe disease and increased need for surgery. so if you smoke and you're diagnosed, now is a good time to quit. what are the symptoms? crohn's disease can affect any area in the gi tract, but it's mostly found in the large and the small intestine. it can also be confined to one area or found in multiple segments. symptoms can range in severity and it can depend on the area of the gi tract that's affected. you also may experience periods of remission when you have no symptoms or issues at all. the symptoms can come on gradually, but they can also show up suddenly. and these can include diarrhea, fever, fatigue, abdominal pain and cramping, blood in your stool, mouth sores, reduced appetite and weight loss. if your crohn's disease has caused fistulas or inflamed tunnels in the skin near the anal area, you may notice pain or drainage. and in more severe cases, you may have inflammation of the eyes, skin, joints, liver or bile ducts, kidney stones, and anemia. in children, it can delay growth and development. over time, crohn's disease can lead to other complications, including bowel obstruction, ulcers, fistulas, anal fissures, malnutrition, and other health problems. it can also increase your risk for blood clots and colon cancer. having these symptoms doesn't automatically mean you have crohn's. but if you're experiencing anything that concerns you, it's a good idea to make an appointment with your doctor. how is it diagnosed? there's no single test for crohn's disease, and it has similar symptoms to a lot of other conditions, so it can take a little time to get a diagnosis. first, your doctor is going to consider your medical history. then your doctor may want to run a variety of tests or procedures. and at some point, your general practitioner may want to refer you to a specialist called a gastroenterologist like myself. a blood test can check for anemia and check for signs of infection. a stool study can test if there's blood present or rule out certain pathogens. a colonoscopy may be needed. this also allows your doctor to view your entire colon and the very end of the ileum using an endoscope, a small camera mounted on a thin flexible tube. they can take tissue samples for a biopsy at the same time. and the presence of granulomas or clusters of inflammatory cells, can essentially confirm the diagnosis. a ct scan might be ordered for a better look at the bowel and all of the surrounding tissues; or an mri, which is especially good for evaluating fistulas around the anus or the small intestine. a capsule endoscopy can be done. here you actually swallow the camera about the size of a large vitamin and it takes images of your digestive tract as it travels through. and a balloon-assisted enteroscopy may be done to get further into the bowel than a standard endoscope can if abnormalities have been found that need further investigation. how is it treated? your doctor can work with you to find therapies that alleviate your symptoms. one of the main goals is to reduce the inflammation that produces painful and disruptive issues. another is to limit complications over the long-term. there is currently no cure, but many treatments can provide a lot of relief, and in some cases, even long-term remission. these may include anti-inflammatory drugs like corticosteroids, immune system suppressants, and antibiotics. certain biologics, which target proteins made by the immune system, can help. antidiarrheals, pain relievers, and supplements can help counter other symptoms. nutritional therapy and a special diet may be recommended. and in some cases where other measures aren't effective, surgery may be required. and that's to remove the damaged tissue. some of these therapies may have side effects themselves. so be sure and review the risks and benefits with your doctor. what now? crohn's disease can be physically and emotionally challenging, but there are things that can help. although there's no firm evidence that any particular foods cause crohn's disease, certain things seem to aggravate flare-ups. so a food diary can help you identify personal triggers. beyond that, limit dairy products, eating smaller meals, stay hydrated, and try to avoid caffeine, alcohol, and carbonation. consider multivitamins if you're concerned about weight loss. or if your diet has become too limited, talk to a registered dietitian. and again, if you smoke, you should stop. it's important to take care of your mental health too. find ways to manage stress, like exercise, breathing, relaxation techniques or biofeedback. some symptoms like abdominal pain, gas, and diarrhea... they can cause anxiety and frustration. they can make it difficult to go out in public for any amount of time. it can feel limiting and isolating and lead to depression. so learn as much as you can about crohn's. staying informed can help a lot in feeling like you're in control of your condition. talk to a therapist, especially one familiar with inflammatory bowel disease. your doctor can give you some recommendations. and you might want to find a support group of people going through the same thing that you are. crohn's disease is a complex disease. but having expert medical care and developing a treatment strategy can make it more manageable and even help you get back to the freedom of your normal life. meanwhile, significant advances continue to be made in understanding and treating the disease, getting us closer to curing it or preventing it entirely. if you'd like to learn more about crohn's disease, here are other related videos or visit mayoclinic.org. we wish you

sorry something went wrong with your subscription please, try again in a couple of minutes retry causesthe exact cause of crohn's disease remains unknown. previously, diet and stress were suspected, but now doctors know that these factors may aggravate, but don't cause, crohn's disease. several factors likely play a role in its development. immune system. it's possible that a virus or bacterium may trigger crohn's disease; however, scientists have yet to identify such a trigger. when your immune system tries to fight off an invading microorganism or environmental triggers, an atypical immune response causes the immune system to attack the cells in the digestive tract, too. heredity. crohn's disease is more common in people who have family members with the disease, so genes may play a role in making people more likely to have it. however, most people with crohn's disease do not have a family history of the disease. risk factorsrisk factors for crohn's disease may include: age. crohn's disease can occur at any age, but you're likely to develop the condition when you're young. most people who develop crohn's disease are diagnosed before they're around 30 years old. ethnicity. although crohn's disease can affect any ethnic group, whites have the highest risk, especially people of eastern european (ashkenazi) jewish descent. however, the incidence of crohn's disease is increasing among black people who live in north america and the united kingdom. crohn's disease is also being increasingly seen in the middle eastern population and among migrants to the united states. family history. you're at higher risk if you have a first-degree relative, such as a parent, sibling or child, with the disease. as many as 1 in 5 people with crohn's disease has a family member with the disease. cigarette smoking. cigarette smoking is the most important controllable risk factor for developing crohn's disease. smoking also leads to more-severe disease and a greater risk of having surgery. if you smoke, it's important to stop. nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications. these include ibuprofen (advil, motrin ib, others), naproxen sodium (aleve), diclofenac sodium and others. while they do not cause crohn's disease, they can lead to inflammation of the bowel that makes crohn's disease worse. complicationscrohn's disease may lead to one or more of the following complications: bowel obstruction. crohn's disease can affect the entire thickness of the intestinal wall. over time, parts of the bowel can scar and narrow, which may block the flow of digestive contents, often known as a stricture. you may require surgery to widen the stricture or sometimes to remove the diseased portion of your bowel. ulcers. chronic inflammation can lead to open sores (ulcers) anywhere in your digestive tract, including your mouth and anus, and in the genital area (perineum). fistulas. sometimes ulcers can extend completely through the intestinal wall, creating a fistula \u2014 an abnormal connection between different body parts. fistulas can develop between your intestine and your skin, or between your intestine and another organ. fistulas near or around the anal area (perianal) are the most common kind. when fistulas develop inside the abdomen, it may lead to infections and abscesses, which are collections of pus. these can be life-threatening if not treated. fistulas may form between loops of bowel, in the bladder or vagina, or through the skin, causing continuous drainage of bowel contents to your skin. anal fissure. this is a small tear in the tissue that lines the anus or in the skin around the anus where infections can occur. it's often associated with painful bowel movements and may lead to a perianal fistula. malnutrition. diarrhea, abdominal pain and cramping may make it difficult for you to eat or for your intestine to absorb enough nutrients to keep you nourished. it's also common to develop anemia due to low iron or vitamin b-12 caused by the disease. colon cancer. having crohn's disease that affects your colon increases your risk of colon cancer. general colon cancer screening guidelines for people without crohn's disease call for a colonoscopy at least every 10 years beginning at age 45. in people with crohn's disease affecting a large part of the colon, a colonoscopy to screen for colon cancer is recommended about 8 years after disease onset and generally is performed every 1 to 2 years afterward. ask your doctor whether you need to have this test done sooner and more frequently. skin disorders. many people with crohn's disease may also develop a condition called hidradenitis suppurativa. this skin disorder involves deep nodules, tunnels and abscesses in the armpits, groin, under the breasts, and in the perianal or genital area. other health problems. crohn's disease can also cause problems in other parts of the body. among these problems are low iron (anemia), osteoporosis, arthritis, and gallbladder or liver disease. medication risks. certain crohn's disease drugs that act by blocking functions of the immune system are associated with a small risk of developing cancers such as lymphoma and skin cancers. they also increase the risk of infections. corticosteroids can be associated with a risk of osteoporosis, bone fractures, cataracts, glaucoma, diabetes and high blood pressure, among other conditions. work with your doctor to determine risks and benefits of medications. blood clots. crohn's disease increases the risk of blood clots in veins and arteries. by mayo

crohn's disease is a chronic (long-lasting) disease that causes inflammation in your digestive tract. it can affect any part of your digestive tract, which runs from your mouth to your anus. but it usually affects your small intestine and the beginning of your large intestine. crohn's disease is an inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). ulcerative colitis and microscopic colitis are other common types of ibd. what causes crohn's disease? the cause of crohn's disease is unknown. researchers think that an autoimmune reaction may be one cause. an autoimmune reaction happens when your immune system attacks healthy cells in your body. genetics may also play a role, since crohn's disease can run in families. stress and eating certain foods don't cause the disease, but they can make your symptoms worse. who is more likely to develop crohn's disease? there are certain factors that may raise your risk of crohn's disease: family history of the disease. having a parent, child, or sibling with the disease puts you at higher risk. smoking. this may double your risk of developing crohn's disease. certain medicines, such as antibiotics, birth-control pills, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) such as aspirin or ibuprofen. these may slightly increase your chance of developing crohn's. a high-fat diet. this may also slightly increase your risk of crohn's. what are the symptoms of crohn's disease? the symptoms of crohn's disease can vary, depending where and how severe your inflammation is. the most common symptoms include: diarrhea cramping and pain in your abdomen weight loss some other possible symptoms are: anemia, a condition in which you have fewer red blood cells than normal eye redness or pain fatigue fever joint pain or soreness nausea or loss of appetite skin changes that involve red, tender bumps under the skin stress and eating certain foods such as carbonated (fizzy) drinks and high-fiber foods may make some people's symptoms worse. what other problems can crohn's disease cause? crohn's disease can cause other problems, including: intestinal obstruction, a blockage in the intestine fistulas, abnormal connections between two parts inside of the body abscesses, pus-filled pockets of infection anal fissures, small tears in your anus that may cause itching, pain, or bleeding ulcers, open sores in your mouth, intestines, anus, or perineum malnutrition, when your body does not get the right amount of vitamins, minerals, and nutrients it needs inflammation in other areas of your body, such as your joints, eyes, and skin how is crohn's disease diagnosed? your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis: a medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms a family history a physical exam, including: checking for bloating in your abdomen. listening to sounds within your abdomen using a stethoscope. tapping on your abdomen to check for tenderness and pain and to see if your liver or spleen is abnormal or enlarged. various tests, including: blood and stool tests. a colonoscopy. an upper gi endoscopy, a procedure in which your provider uses a scope to look inside your mouth, esophagus, stomach, and small intestine. diagnostic imaging tests, such as a ct scan or an upper gi series. an upper gi series uses a special liquid called barium and x-rays. drinking the barium will make your upper gi tract more visible on an x-ray. what are the treatments for crohn's disease? there is no cure for crohn's disease, but treatments can decrease inflammation in your intestines, relieve symptoms, and prevent complications. treatments include medicines, bowel rest, and surgery. no single treatment works for everyone. you and your provider can work together to figure out which treatment is best for you: medicines for crohn's include various medicines that decrease the inflammation. many of these medicines do this by reducing the activity of your immune system. certain medicines can also help with symptoms or complications, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and anti-diarrheal medicines. if your crohn's causes an infection, you may need antibiotics. bowel rest involves drinking only certain liquids or not eating or drinking anything. this allows your intestines to rest. you may need to do this if your crohn's disease symptoms are severe. you get your nutrients through drinking a liquid, a feeding tube, or an intravenous (iv) tube. you may need to do bowel rest in the hospital, or you may be able to do it at home. it will last for a few days or up to several weeks. surgery can treat complications and reduce symptoms when other treatments are not helping enough. the surgery will involve removing a damaged part of your digestive tract to treat: fistulas bleeding that is life threatening intestinal obstructions side effects from medicines when they threaten your health symptoms when medicines do not improve your condition changing your diet can help reduce symptoms. your provider may recommend that you make changes to your diet, such as: avoiding carbonated drinks avoiding popcorn, vegetable skins, nuts, and other high-fiber foods drinking more liquids eating smaller meals more often keeping a food diary to help identify foods that cause problems in some cases, your provider may ask you to go on a special diet, such as a diet that is: high calorie lactose free low fat low fiber low salt if you are not absorbing enough nutrients, you may need to take nutritional supplements and vitamins. national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases start here crohn's disease (national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases) also in spanish what is crohn's disease?

of inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). the condition inflames and irritates the digestive tract \u2014 specifically the small and large intestines. crohn\u2019s disease can cause diarrhea and stomach cramps. it\u2019s common to experience periodic disease flare-ups.crohn\u2019s disease gets its name from american gastroenterologist dr. burrill crohn (1884-1983). he was one of the first physicians to describe the illness in 1932. ulcerative colitis is another commonly diagnosed ibd.advertisementcleveland clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. advertising on our site helps support our mission. we do not endorse non-cleveland clinic products or services. policyhow common is crohn\u2019s disease?an estimated half a million americans have crohn\u2019s disease. this can include men, women and children.who might get crohn\u2019s disease?crohn\u2019s disease typically appears in younger people \u2013 often in their late teens, 20s or early 30s. however, this condition can happen at any age. it\u2019s equally common in men and women. crohn\u2019s disease can also be see in young children.if you\u2019re a cigarette smoker, your risk of crohn\u2019s disease might be higher than non-smokers.advertisementwhat are the types of crohn\u2019s disease?crohn\u2019s disease can affect different sections of the digestive tract. types of crohn\u2019s disease include:ileocolitis: inflammation occurs in the small intestine and part of the large intestine, or colon. ileocolitis is the most common type of crohn\u2019s disease.ileitis: swelling and inflammation develop in the small intestine (ileum).gastroduodenal: inflammation and irritation affect the stomach and the top of the small intestine (the duodenum).jejunoileitis: patchy areas of inflammation develop in the upper half of the small intestine (called the jejunum).symptoms and causeswhat causes crohn\u2019s disease?there\u2019s no known cause of crohn\u2019s disease. certain factors may increase your risk of developing the condition, including:autoimmune disease: bacteria in the digestive tract may cause the body\u2019s immune system to attack your healthy cells.genes: inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) often runs in families. if you have a parent, sibling or other family member with crohn\u2019s, you may be at an increased risk of also having it. there are several specific mutations (changes) to your genes that can predispose people to developing crohn\u2019s disease.smoking: cigarette smoking could as much as double your risk of crohn\u2019s disease.advertisementwhat are the symptoms of crohn\u2019s disease?people with crohn\u2019s disease can experience periods of severe symptoms (flare-ups) followed by periods of no or very mild symptoms (remission). remission can last weeks or even years. there\u2019s no way to predict when flare-ups will happen.if you have crohn\u2019s disease, symptoms you might have can include:abdominal pain.chronic diarrhea.a feeling of fullness.fever.a loss of your appetite.weight loss.abnormal skin tags (usually on your buttocks).anal fissures.anal fistulas.rectal bleeding.diagnosis and testshow is crohn's disease diagnosed?most people with crohn\u2019s first see a healthcare provider because of ongoing diarrhea, belly cramping or unexplained weight loss. if you have a child who has been experiencing the symptoms of crohn\u2019s disease, reach out to your pediatrician.to find the cause of your symptoms, your healthcare provider may order one or more of these tests:blood test: a blood test checks for high numbers of white blood cells that may indicate inflammation or infection. the test also checks for low red blood cell count, or anemia. approximately one in three people with crohn\u2019s disease have anemia.stool test: this test looks at a sample of your stool to check for bacteria or parasites. it can rule out infections that cause chronic diarrhea.colonoscopy: during a colonoscopy, your doctor uses an endoscope (thin tube with an attached light and camera) to examine the inside of your colon. your doctor may take a tissue sample (biopsy) from the colon to test for signs of inflammation.computed tomography (ct) scan: a ct scan creates images of the digestive tract. it tells your healthcare provider how severe the intestinal inflammation is.upper gastrointestinal (gi) endoscopy: your doctor threads a long, thin tube called an endoscope through your mouth and into your throat. an attached camera allows your doctor to see inside. during an upper endoscopy, your doctor may also take tissue samples.upper gastrointestinal (gi) exam: x-ray images used during an upper gi exam allow your doctor to watch as a swallowed barium liquid moves through your digestive tract.management and treatmenthow is crohn\u2019s disease managed or treated?treatment for crohn\u2019s disease varies depending on what\u2019s causing your symptoms and how severe they are for you. in children, the goal in treatment is to induce remission (the time between symptom flare-ups), maintain remission and manage any complications of crohn\u2019s disease over time.your healthcare provider may recommend one or more of these treatments for crohn's disease:antibiotics: antibiotics can prevent or treat infections. severe infections can lead to abscesses (pockets of pus). or they can cause fistulas (openings or tunnels that connect two organs that don\u2019t normally connect).antidiarrheal medication: prescription medications like loperamide (imodium a-d\u00ae) can stop severe diarrhea.biologics: these medications include monoclonal antibodies to suppress the immune response.bowel rest: to give your intestines a chance to heal, your provider may recommend going without food or drink for several days or longer. to get the nutrition you need, you may receive intravenous (parenteral) nutrition. only drink a prescribed liquid or have a feeding tube during this time.corticosteroids: cortisone, prednisone and other corticosteroids ease inflammation brought on by autoimmune disease.immunomodulators: these drugs calm inflammation by suppressing an overactive immune system. they include azathioprine and cyclosporine.surgery: surgery won\u2019t cure crohn\u2019s disease, but it can treat complications. you may need surgery to correct intestinal perforations (holes), blockages or bleeding.what are the complications of crohn\u2019s disease?crohn\u2019s disease can lead to serious complications, including:abscesses: infected pus-filled pockets form in the digestive tract or abdomen.anal fissures: small tears in the anus (anal fissures) can cause pain, itching and bleeding.bowel obstructions: scar tissue from inflammation, fistulas or a narrowed intestine can block the bowel partially or completely. waste matter and gases build up. a blockage in the small bowel or large bowel requires surgery.colon cancer: crohn\u2019s disease in the large intestine increases the risk of colon cancer.fistulas: ibd can cause abnormal tunnel-like openings, called fistulas, to form in the intestinal walls. these fistulas sometimes become
